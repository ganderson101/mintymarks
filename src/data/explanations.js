      title: "Rounding & Place Value",
      keyIdea: "Every digit in a number has a position — its place — and rounding means replacing a number with the nearest 'clean' value at that place.",
      body: `Numbers are built from digits arranged in columns: thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones (units). The position of a digit tells you its value — the 4 in 4,700 is worth four thousand, not just four.

Rounding simplifies a number to a given place value. The golden rule is simple: look at the digit immediately to the RIGHT of the place you are rounding to.

• If that digit is 5 or more → round UP (increase the target digit by 1).
• If that digit is 4 or less → round DOWN (keep the target digit the same).

Then replace every digit to the right of the target place with a zero.

Example — Round 5,483 to the nearest 1,000:
The thousands digit is 5. Look one place right: the hundreds digit is 4. Because 4 < 5, round down. Answer: 5,000.

Example — Round 6,572 to the nearest 10:
The tens digit is 7. Look one place right: the ones digit is 2. Because 2 < 5, round down. Answer: 6,570.

A useful trick: draw a vertical line after the place you are rounding to. Everything to the left stays (or goes up by 1). Everything to the right becomes zero.

Rounding is used constantly in real life — estimating shopping costs, reading data on a graph, or reporting population figures. It also helps you check whether your calculator answer is sensible: "Is 6,572 rounded to the nearest 1,000 closer to 6,000 or 7,000?" Running that quick check prevents errors.`,
      workedExample: {
        problem: "Round 7,468 to the nearest 100.",
        solution: "Target place: hundreds (the 4). Digit to its right: 6. Since 6 ≥ 5, round up: 4 becomes 5. Digits to the right become 0. Answer: 7,500."

    "Addition & subtraction": {
      title: "Addition & Subtraction",
      keyIdea: "Addition combines amounts together; subtraction finds the difference — and both can be done reliably with column methods when numbers get large.",
      body: `For large numbers, the column method is the most reliable strategy. Line numbers up so that digits with the same place value sit in the same column (ones under ones, tens under tens, and so on).

ADDITION — column method:
Add each column starting from the RIGHT (ones first). If a column adds to 10 or more, write down the units digit and carry the tens digit to the next column on the left.

Example: 865 + 7,534
    7 5 3 4
  +   8 6 5
  ─────────
    8 3 9 9

Work right to left: 4+5=9, 3+6=9, 5+8=13 (write 3 carry 1), 7+0+1=8. Answer: 8,399.

SUBTRACTION — column method:
Subtract each column from right to left. If the top digit is smaller than the bottom, borrow 10 from the column to its left (reduce that column's top digit by 1).

Checking your answer: always add your answer back to the number you subtracted — it should give you the starting number. This 30-second check catches most errors.

Mental strategies for smaller calculations:
• Near-doubles: 46 + 48 = 2 × 47 = 94
• Bridging through 10/100: 376 + 58 = 376 + 24 + 34 = 400 + 34 = 434
• Counting up for subtraction: 503 − 478 → count up 2 to 480, then 23 to 503 = 25`,

    "Multiplication & division": {
      title: "Multiplication & Division",
      keyIdea: "Multiplication is repeated addition; division is splitting into equal groups — and knowing your times tables makes both dramatically faster.",
      body: `MULTIPLICATION
Times tables (2× to 12×) are the foundation. Every multiplication problem, no matter how large, relies on them. Practise until they are instant recall.

For multiplying larger numbers, use the grid method or the standard short multiplication algorithm.

Grid method for 34 × 6:
Split 34 into 30 + 4.
30 × 6 = 180
 4 × 6 =  24
Total: 180 + 24 = 204

For two-digit × two-digit (e.g., 34 × 26), use a 2×2 grid:
      30      4
20 | 600  |  80 |  → 680
 6 | 180  |  24 |  → 204
Total: 680 + 204 = 884

DIVISION
Short division (bus stop method) works for dividing by a single digit. Write the dividend inside the 'bus stop', divisor outside. Divide each digit left to right, carrying any remainder to the next digit.

Example: 96 ÷ 4
4 into 9 = 2 remainder 1. Carry the 1. 4 into 16 = 4. Answer: 24.

The connection to multiplication: division is the inverse of multiplication. If 6 × 7 = 42, then 42 ÷ 7 = 6 and 42 ÷ 6 = 7. Use this fact to check every division answer.

Remainders: if a division doesn't work out exactly, express the leftover as a remainder (e.g., 29 ÷ 4 = 7 remainder 1).`,
      workedExample: {
        problem: "What is 11 × 12?",
        solution: "Split: 11 × 12 = 11 × 10 + 11 × 2 = 110 + 22 = 132. Or from times tables: 11 × 12 = 132."

    "Fractions, decimals & percentages": {
      title: "Fractions, Decimals & Percentages",
      keyIdea: "Fractions, decimals, and percentages are three different ways to write the same idea — a part of a whole.",
      body: `FRACTIONS
A fraction has a numerator (top) and a denominator (bottom). The denominator tells you how many equal parts the whole is split into; the numerator tells you how many of those parts you have.

Finding a fraction of an amount:
Step 1: Divide by the denominator.
Step 2: Multiply by the numerator.
Memory trick: "Divide by the bottom, times by the top."

Example: 2/5 of 40
Step 1: 40 ÷ 5 = 8
Step 2: 8 × 2 = 16 ✓

Example: 8/10 of 100
Step 1: 100 ÷ 10 = 10
Step 2: 10 × 8 = 80 ✓

DECIMALS
Decimals extend the place value system past the decimal point: tenths, hundredths, thousandths. 0.3 = 3/10, 0.25 = 25/100 = 1/4.

PERCENTAGES
Per cent means "out of 100". To find a percentage of an amount, convert to a decimal and multiply, OR use the divide-then-multiply method: 30% of 400 → find 10% first (÷10 = 40), then multiply (×3 = 120).

KEY CONVERSIONS to memorise:
1/2 = 0.5 = 50%
1/4 = 0.25 = 25%
3/4 = 0.75 = 75%
1/5 = 0.2 = 20%
1/10 = 0.1 = 10%

      title: "Properties of 2D Shapes",
      keyIdea: "Every 2D shape is defined by the number of its sides and angles — learn the names and their properties once, and you have them for life.",
      body: `A polygon is any 2D shape made from straight sides. The name tells you the number of sides.

NAMES TO KNOW:
Triangle         3 sides
Quadrilateral    4 sides   (square, rectangle, parallelogram, rhombus, trapezium, kite)
Pentagon         5 sides
Hexagon          6 sides
Heptagon         7 sides
Octagon          8 sides
Nonagon          9 sides
Decagon         10 sides

REGULAR vs IRREGULAR:
A regular polygon has all sides equal AND all angles equal (e.g., a regular hexagon has 6 equal sides and six 120° angles). An irregular polygon has sides or angles that differ.

KEY QUADRILATERAL PROPERTIES:
• Square: 4 equal sides, 4 right angles (90°), all sides parallel in pairs.
• Rectangle: opposite sides equal, 4 right angles.
• Parallelogram: opposite sides equal and parallel, opposite angles equal.
• Rhombus: 4 equal sides, opposite sides parallel, opposite angles equal.
• Trapezium: exactly one pair of parallel sides.
• Kite: two pairs of adjacent equal sides, one pair of equal angles.

ANGLES IN POLYGONS:
Angles inside any triangle add to 180°.
Angles inside any quadrilateral add to 360°.
General rule: sum of interior angles = (n − 2) × 180°, where n is the number of sides.

LINES OF SYMMETRY:
A square has 4 lines of symmetry. An equilateral triangle has 3. A rectangle has 2. A regular pentagon has 5. A shape with no lines of symmetry (like a scalene triangle) is asymmetric.`,

      title: "Coordinates & Translations",
      keyIdea: "A coordinate is an address for a point on a grid — always read along the corridor (x-axis) first, then up the stairs (y-axis).",
      body: `COORDINATES
A coordinate pair (x, y) gives the exact position of a point on a grid.
• x is the horizontal distance from the origin (0, 0) — read left or right.
• y is the vertical distance from the origin — read up or down.

Memory trick: "Along the corridor, then up the stairs" → x first, then y.

Positive x → right of origin. Negative x → left.
Positive y → above origin. Negative y → below.

Example: The point (4, 7) is 4 units right and 7 units up from the origin.

TRANSLATIONS
A translation slides a shape to a new position without rotating or flipping it. Every point moves the same distance in the same direction.

A translation is described as "a right/left and b up/down."
To find the new coordinates of a point (x, y) translated a right and b up:
New coordinates = (x + a, y + b)

If the translation is to the LEFT, subtract from x.
If the translation is DOWN, subtract from y.

Example: Point (4, 7) translated 1 right and 4 up:
New x = 4 + 1 = 5
New y = 7 + 4 = 11
New coordinates: (5, 11)

REFLECTIONS AND ROTATIONS (brief overview):
• Reflection: mirror image across a mirror line.
• Rotation: turn around a fixed centre point, described by angle (90°, 180°, 270°) and direction (clockwise or anti-clockwise).

When plotting coordinates, always use a sharp pencil and mark with a small × rather than a dot — it is more precise.`,

LENGTH
10 mm = 1 cm
100 cm = 1 m

283 cm to mm: multiply by 10 → 2,830 mm
3.5 km to m: multiply by 1,000 → 3,500 m
4,500 m to km: divide by 1,000 → 4.5 km

MASS
1,000 g = 1 kg
1,000 kg = 1 tonne

CAPACITY

      body: `Statistics at KS2 focuses on reading data from charts and calculating the mean.

THE MEAN (average)
The mean is the most common measure of average. It represents the value you would get if all the data were shared out equally.

How to calculate the mean:
Step 1: Add all the values together (find the total).
Step 2: Divide the total by how many values there are (the count).

Mean = Total ÷ Count

Example: Mean of 24, 24, 18, 6
Total: 24 + 24 + 18 + 6 = 72
Count: 4 values
Mean: 72 ÷ 4 = 18

Example: Mean of 37, 28, 7
Total: 37 + 28 + 7 = 72
Count: 3 values
Mean: 72 ÷ 3 = 24

The mean does not have to be one of the original values in the data set — and it does not have to be a whole number.

READING CHARTS
Bar charts: the height (or length) of each bar shows the frequency for that category.
Pictograms: each symbol represents a fixed number — always check the key.
Line graphs: used to show change over time.
Tally charts: each tally mark = 1; groups of 5 are written as four vertical marks and one diagonal.

A sequence is a list of numbers that follow a pattern. To continue a sequence, identify the rule first.

LINEAR SEQUENCES (add or subtract the same amount each time):
Example: 5, 7, 9, 11, …
Each term increases by +2. Rule: "add 2". Next term: 11 + 2 = 13.

Example: 4, 6, 8, 10, …
Common difference: +2. Next term: 12.

To describe any linear sequence: find the first term and the common difference.

OTHER PATTERNS:
Doubling sequences: 2, 4, 8, 16, … (multiply by 2 each time)
Halving sequences: 80, 40, 20, 10, … (divide by 2 each time)
Fibonacci-style: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, … (add the two previous terms)

SIMPLE ALGEBRA
A letter (variable) stands for an unknown number. Algebra is just arithmetic with an unknown.

If 3 + x = 10, then x = 7 (because 3 + 7 = 10).
If 2 × n = 14, then n = 7.

The idea: whatever operation was done to x, do the inverse to both sides to find x.
"Balance the equation" — both sides must always be equal.

FUNCTION MACHINES

      body: `RATIO
A ratio compares two (or more) quantities of the same type. It is written with a colon: 4 : 2 means "4 parts to 2 parts."

SIMPLIFYING RATIOS
A ratio is in its simplest form when the numbers share no common factor other than 1. To simplify, find the HCF (highest common factor) of both numbers and divide both by it.

Example: Simplify 4 : 2
HCF of 4 and 2 is 2. Divide both: 4 ÷ 2 = 2, 2 ÷ 2 = 1.
Simplified: 2 : 1.

Example: Simplify 15 : 5
HCF is 5. 15 ÷ 5 = 3, 5 ÷ 5 = 1.
Simplified: 3 : 1.

SHARING IN A RATIO
To share an amount in a ratio:
Step 1: Find the total number of parts (add the ratio numbers).
Step 2: Divide the amount by the total number of parts to find the value of one part.
Step 3: Multiply each ratio number by the value of one part.

Example: Share £30 in the ratio 2 : 1.
Total parts = 2 + 1 = 3.
One part = £30 ÷ 3 = £10.
Shares: £10 × 2 = £20 and £10 × 1 = £10.

PROPORTION
Proportion is about equivalent relationships — if 3 pencils cost 90p, then 1 pencil costs 30p (÷3) and 6 pencils cost 180p (×2). This is the unitary method: find the value of one unit first.

    "Forces & magnets": {
      title: "Forces & Magnets",
      keyIdea: "A force is a push or pull that makes things move, stop, or change shape — and magnets are special because they can exert forces without even touching.",
      body: `A FORCE is a push or pull that acts on an object. Forces can make things move, stop them from moving, slow them down, speed them up, or change their shape. We feel forces all the time: gravity pulls us down, the ground pushes up on our feet, and our muscles push and pull to move us around.

CONTACT FORCES
Contact forces happen when two objects touch. Examples include:
• Pushes and pulls — you pushing a door open, pulling a rope
• Friction — the force between surfaces that slows things down (like shoes on a floor)
• Air resistance — friction from the air that slows falling leaves and parachutes

AT-A-DISTANCE FORCES
Some forces work without touching! Gravity is invisible but very real — it pulls everything toward Earth. Magnets are another at-a-distance force: they can attract or repel (push away) other magnets or magnetic materials without contact.

MAGNETS & MAGNETIC MATERIALS
A magnet has two poles: North and South. When you bring two magnets together, opposite poles attract (North pulls South), but same poles repel (North pushes North away). Not all metals are magnetic — only iron, steel, nickel, and cobalt are attracted to magnets.

EARTH AS A MAGNET
Earth itself is a giant magnet! The North Pole of Earth's magnetic field points roughly toward the geographic North. Compasses use this: their magnetic needle aligns with Earth's magnetic field, always pointing roughly north.

In summary: forces are pushes and pulls (contact), gravity and magnetism work at a distance, and understanding forces helps us explain why things move the way they do.`,
      workedExample: {
        problem: "A child pushes a toy car across a carpet. Describe the forces acting on the toy car.",
        solution: "The push from the child's hand is a contact force moving the car forward. Friction between the car's wheels and the carpet is a contact force opposing the motion, slowing the car down. Gravity pulls the car downward, and the carpet pushes upward (normal force) to support it. The car eventually stops because friction overcomes the push."

    "Light & shadows": {
      title: "Light & Shadows",
      keyIdea: "Light travels in straight lines from sources, and shadows form when light is blocked by opaque objects.",
      body: `LIGHT SOURCES
Light comes from sources. The Sun is our main natural light source. Artificial sources include electric lights, candles, and glowing screens. Light travels very fast in straight lines from its source.

HOW WE SEE
We see objects because light bounces off them and enters our eyes. A light source emits light, that light bounces off an object (reflection), and the reflected light reaches our eyes. Without light, we cannot see — this is why it's dark at night or in a sealed box.

TRANSPARENT, TRANSLUCENT, AND OPAQUE
Materials react differently to light:
• Transparent materials (clear glass, water) let light pass straight through — you can see clearly.
• Translucent materials (frosted glass, thin fabric) let some light through but scatter it — you see shadows and blurry outlines.
• Opaque materials (wood, brick, your body) block light completely — no light gets through.

SHADOWS
A shadow forms when light is blocked by an opaque object. If a bright light source shines on an opaque object, the light cannot pass through, so a dark shadow appears on the opposite side. The closer the object is to the light, the larger and sharper the shadow. The farther away, the smaller and softer the shadow.

REFLECTION
When light bounces off a shiny surface (like a mirror), it reflects at the same angle it hit. A smooth mirror reflects light in an organized way, producing a clear image. A bumpy surface (like white paper) scatters reflected light in all directions, so you see diffuse reflection — not a clear image.

In summary: light travels in straight lines, we see by light bouncing into our eyes, and shadows and reflections happen when light bounces off or is blocked by objects.`,
      workedExample: {
        problem: "Explain why a shadow becomes larger and sharper when a light source moves closer to an object.",
        solution: "When a light source is far away, the light rays spread out widely. When it moves closer, the light rays become more direct and concentrated. The closer the light, the more completely the object blocks the light rays, creating a larger, sharper-edged shadow. The farther the light, the more light rays curve around the object, creating a smaller, softer shadow."

    "Sound": {
      title: "Sound",
      keyIdea: "Sound is made by vibrations that travel through air or other materials as invisible waves, and the faster the vibrations, the higher the pitch.",
      body: `VIBRATIONS AND SOUND
Sound is made by vibrations — when something shakes back and forth very quickly, it creates sound. Pluck a guitar string and you see it vibrate; that vibration makes the air around it vibrate, and those vibrations reach your ear as sound waves.

SOUND TRAVELS
Sound needs a medium (a material) to travel through: air, water, or solid objects. It travels outward from the source in all directions. Sound does not travel in space (no air) — this is why astronauts must use radio to communicate.

PITCH
Pitch is how high or low a sound is. Pitch depends on the frequency of vibrations:
• Fast vibrations → high pitch (like a whistle or a bird's chirp)
• Slow vibrations → low pitch (like a drum or a lion's roar)

A high-pitched sound vibrates many times per second; a low-pitched sound vibrates fewer times per second.

VOLUME (LOUDNESS)
Volume is how loud or quiet a sound is. Volume depends on the size (amplitude) of the vibrations:
• Big vibrations → loud sound
• Small vibrations → quiet sound

When you hit a drum gently, the head vibrates a little and makes a quiet sound. When you hit it hard, the head vibrates a lot and makes a loud sound.

DISTANCE AND SOUND
Sound gets fainter as it travels farther from the source. This happens because the sound energy spreads out over a larger area. A person shouting nearby sounds much louder than the same person shouting from a distance.

In summary: sound is made by vibrations, travels through materials as waves, and we describe it by pitch (high or low) and volume (loud or quiet).`,
      workedExample: {
        problem: "Why does a bell sound different (higher pitch) when struck harder, and why does it sound quieter if you move far away?",
        solution: "Striking harder makes the bell vibrate with larger movements (bigger amplitude) → louder volume. The pitch depends on how fast the bell vibrates, not how hard you strike it, so the pitch stays the same. When you move away, the sound waves spread out over a larger area, so less sound energy reaches your ear → you hear it as quieter. The pitch remains the same because the vibration frequency hasn't changed."

    "Electricity": {
      title: "Electricity",
      keyIdea: "Electricity flows through conductors in a circuit to power devices — and insulators block it, which is why we wrap wires in plastic.",
      body: `CIRCUITS
An electric circuit is a closed loop that electricity can flow through. A basic circuit needs:
1. A power source (battery or cell)
2. Wires to carry the electricity
3. A device (like a bulb) that uses the electricity
4. A switch to control the flow

If any part is broken or not connected, the circuit is open and electricity cannot flow — the bulb will not light.

CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS
Electricity flows easily through some materials (conductors), like copper, aluminum, and other metals. Some materials block electricity (insulators), like plastic, rubber, and wood.

This is why electrical cords are made of copper wire (a conductor) wrapped in plastic (an insulator) — the copper carries electricity safely, and the plastic prevents shocks.

CELLS AND BATTERIES
A cell (or battery) is a source of electrical energy. A single cell has two terminals: positive (+) and negative (−). The positive terminal pushes electricity out, and the negative terminal receives it back. When cells are connected in series (end to end), their voltages add up, making the electricity stronger.

BRIGHTNESS AND CIRCUIT RESISTANCE
The brightness of a bulb depends on how much electrical current flows through it. In a simple series circuit with one battery and one bulb, the bulb glows brightly. If you add another bulb to the same circuit, the electricity has to split between them, so each glows dimmer. If you add a longer wire, it creates more resistance, and the bulb glows dimmer.

SWITCHES
A switch controls whether electricity can flow. A closed switch allows current to flow (circuit is complete). An open switch breaks the circuit, stopping the flow. This is how we turn devices on and off safely.

In summary: electricity flows in closed circuits through conductors, conductors like copper and water allow flow, insulators like plastic block it, and switches control the flow.`,
      workedExample: {
        problem: "Two identical bulbs are in separate circuits. Circuit 1 has one battery and one bulb. Circuit 2 has two batteries and one bulb. Which bulb is brighter, and why?",
        solution: "The bulb in Circuit 2 is brighter. The extra battery in Circuit 2 provides more electrical energy, so more current flows through the bulb, making it glow more brightly. The bulb in Circuit 1, with only one battery, receives less electrical energy and glows more dimly."

    "Forces & motion": {
      title: "Forces & Motion",
      keyIdea: "Objects move, speed up, slow down, and change direction because forces act on them — and the bigger the force, the greater the change.",
      body: `SPEED AND MOTION
Motion means something is moving (changing position). Speed describes how fast something is moving. A fast car covers more distance in the same time as a slow car.

FORCES CHANGE MOTION
A force can:
• Make a stationary object start moving (kick a ball)
• Make a moving object stop (catch a ball)
• Make a moving object go faster (kick a rolling ball)
• Make a moving object go slower (friction slows a sliding book)
• Change the direction of a moving object (hit a tennis ball with a racket)

The bigger the force, the bigger the change in motion. A gentle push moves an object slightly; a strong push moves it much more.

GRAVITY
Gravity is a force that pulls everything toward Earth. It acts downward, pulling on all objects. An object dropped from high up falls because gravity pulls it down. Gravity is the reason we stay on the ground instead of floating away.

AIR RESISTANCE
Air resistance is friction caused by air. When something moves through air, the air pushes back on it, slowing it down. A feather falls slowly through air because air resistance is strong relative to the feather's weight. A stone falls faster because its weight is much greater than air resistance.

WATER RESISTANCE
Water resistance (or drag) is friction caused by water. Swimming is harder than walking because water resistance opposes your motion more than air does.

FRICTION
Friction is the force between two surfaces that opposes motion. Rough surfaces create more friction than smooth surfaces. Friction always opposes movement: it slows a sliding book, stops a rolling ball, and heats your hands when you rub them together.

LEVERS, PULLEYS, AND GEARS
Simple machines help us use forces more efficiently:
• Levers: a bar that pivots on a fulcrum (like a seesaw or crowbar) — they make lifting easier by spreading the force over a longer distance.
• Pulleys: wheels with a rope that can redirect force and reduce the effort needed to lift heavy objects.
• Gears: interlocking wheels that transfer force and change direction and speed.

In summary: forces cause motion and change motion; gravity always pulls down; friction, air resistance, and water resistance oppose motion; and simple machines help us use forces more effectively.`,

        problem: "A book is sliding across a wooden table. Explain what forces are acting on the book and why it eventually stops.",
        solution: "The push you gave the book starts its motion. Gravity pulls the book downward, and the table pushes upward to support it (balanced forces, no vertical motion). Friction between the book and the table acts in the opposite direction of motion, opposing the slide. Friction is the unbalanced force here — it gradually removes the book's motion, slowing it down until it stops. The rougher the table, the greater the friction, and the faster it stops."

      body: `THE SUN, EARTH, AND MOON
The Sun is a star that gives us light and heat. Earth is a planet (a large rocky ball) that orbits the Sun. The Moon is Earth's natural satellite — it orbits Earth. All three are roughly spherical (ball-shaped).

DAY AND NIGHT
A day is 24 hours long. During this time, Earth spins once on its axis (an imaginary line through the North and South Poles). As Earth spins, different parts face the Sun:
• When your part of Earth faces the Sun → it's daytime (you see the Sun, the sky is bright)
• When your part faces away from the Sun → it's nighttime (the Sun is below the horizon, the sky is dark)
• The boundary between day and night is called the terminator — it moves across Earth as Earth rotates.

YEARS AND EARTH'S ORBIT
A year is the time it takes Earth to orbit once around the Sun — about 365 days. As Earth orbits, it is always tilted at the same angle (about 23.5°). This tilt causes seasons:
• When your part of Earth is tilted toward the Sun → summer (longer days, more direct sunlight, warmer)
• When your part is tilted away → winter (shorter days, indirect sunlight, colder)
• Spring and autumn are in between.

THE MOON AND LUNAR CYCLE
The Moon orbits Earth once every 29.5 days (a lunar month). We see the Moon because it reflects sunlight. As the Moon orbits, the angle between the Sun, Earth, and Moon changes:
• New Moon: Moon is between Earth and Sun; the sunlit side faces away from us (invisible)
• Full Moon: Earth is between Sun and Moon; the entire sunlit side faces us (bright)
• Half-Moon (Quarters): the Sun, Earth, and Moon form a right angle; we see half the illuminated side

These are the phases of the Moon.

PLANETS AND STARS
Our solar system contains the Sun and eight planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) orbiting it. Beyond our solar system are trillions of other stars, some with their own planets (exoplanets).

In summary: Earth, the Sun, and the Moon are spherical; Earth's rotation creates day/night; Earth's orbit around the Sun creates years and seasons; the Moon orbits Earth and its phases change over a lunar month.`,

Range: max − min. Measures spread, not average.

      body: `WHAT IS A FORCE?
A force is a push or pull that can change an object's speed, direction, or shape. Forces are measured in newtons (N) and are drawn as arrows showing direction and magnitude.

WEIGHT vs MASS
Mass is the amount of matter in an object, measured in kilograms (kg). Mass does not change wherever you are.
Weight is the gravitational force pulling an object downward, measured in newtons (N). Weight depends on gravitational field strength (g).

W = m × g

On Earth: g = 10 N/kg (use whichever value the question gives).
On the Moon: g ≈ 1.6 N/kg. A 60 kg person weighs 600 N on Earth but only 96 N on the Moon — same mass, different weight.

Example: mass = 46 kg, g = 10 N/kg.
Weight = 46 × 10 = 460 N.

BALANCED AND UNBALANCED FORCES
If all forces on an object balance (resultant force = 0 N), the object is either stationary or moving at constant velocity (Newton's First Law).
If the resultant force is non-zero, the object accelerates in the direction of the resultant force (Newton's Second Law: F = ma).

FORCE DIAGRAMS (free body diagrams)
Draw one arrow per force. Arrow length is proportional to force size. Label each arrow with its name and magnitude.

Common forces:
Friction: opposes motion, acts along the contact surface.
Normal (contact) force: acts perpendicular to a surface.
Air resistance (drag): opposes motion through air; increases with speed.`,

Energy exists in different stores: kinetic, gravitational potential, elastic potential, thermal, chemical, nuclear, and electromagnetic. Energy is measured in joules (J).

ENERGY TRANSFERS
Energy is transferred by:
• Mechanical work (a force moving through a distance): W = F × d
• Heating (conduction, convection, radiation)
• Electrical current
• Waves (light, sound)

POWER
Power is the rate of energy transfer — how much energy is transferred per second.

P = E ÷ t

P = power (watts, W)
E = energy (joules, J)
t = time (seconds, s)

1 watt = 1 joule per second.

Example: A 25 W device runs for 4 s.
Energy transferred = P × t = 25 × 4 = 100 J.

Example: A device uses 700 J at 50 W.
Time = E ÷ P = 700 ÷ 50 = 14 s.

EFFICIENCY
Efficiency = (useful energy output ÷ total energy input) × 100%.
No device is 100% efficient — some energy is always dissipated as thermal energy (wasted heat).

CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
Total energy in a closed system is always conserved. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred from one store to another.

KEY WAVE PROPERTIES
Wavelength (λ): distance between two consecutive identical points on a wave (e.g., crest to crest). Measured in metres (m).
Frequency (f): number of complete waves passing a point per second. Measured in hertz (Hz). 1 Hz = 1 wave/second.
Amplitude: maximum displacement from the rest position. Determines energy/loudness.
Wave speed (v): how fast the wave travels through a medium. Measured in m/s.

      body: `PYTHAGORAS' THEOREM
In a right-angled triangle: a² + b² = c²
where c is the hypotenuse (longest side, opposite the right angle).

Finding the hypotenuse: c = √(a² + b²)
Finding a shorter side: a = √(c² − b²)

Example: hypotenuse 41 cm, one side 9 cm.
Other side = √(41² − 9²) = √(1681 − 81) = √1600 = 40 cm.

TRIGONOMETRY — SOHCAHTOA
Label sides relative to the angle θ: Opposite (O), Adjacent (A), Hypotenuse (H).
sin θ = O/H     cos θ = A/H     tan θ = O/A

To find a side: rearrange (e.g., O = H × sin θ).
To find an angle: use the inverse function (e.g., θ = sin⁻¹(O/H)).

Exactly the same method as two-part ratios — add all the parts first.

Total parts: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. One part: £27 ÷ 9 = £3.
Shares: £3, £9, £15. Largest share = £15.
Check: 3 + 9 + 15 = 27 ✓

DIRECT AND INVERSE PROPORTION
Direct proportion: y = kx. As x doubles, y doubles. Graph: straight line through origin.
Inverse proportion: y = k/x. As x doubles, y halves. Graph: reciprocal curve.

To find k, substitute one known pair of values, then use k to answer the question.

PERCENTAGE CHANGE
% change = (change ÷ original) × 100
Percentage increase/decrease — multiplier method:
Increase by 15% → multiply by 1.15
Decrease by 20% → multiply by 0.80
Reverse percentage: if £92 is after a 15% increase, original = 92 ÷ 1.15

COMPOUND INTEREST
Amount = P × (1 + r/100)ⁿ

v = u + at = 20 + (9 × 4) = 20 + 36 = 56 m/s.

ACCELERATION

X-ray: medical imaging (bone). Gamma: cancer treatment, sterilising equipment.

Hazards: UV causes skin cancer; X-rays and gamma rays ionise cells, damaging DNA.

SOUND WAVES
Longitudinal waves (particles oscillate parallel to direction of travel).
Cannot travel through a vacuum — need a medium (solid, liquid, or gas).

Magnetic field lines run from north to south outside a magnet. The closer the lines, the stronger the field.
A current-carrying wire creates a circular magnetic field around it.
A solenoid (coil of wire) creates a field like a bar magnet when current flows — the right-hand grip rule gives the north pole direction.

FORCE ON A CURRENT-CARRYING CONDUCTOR
When a current-carrying wire is placed in an external magnetic field:
F = B × I × L

F = force (N), B = magnetic flux density (T), I = current (A), L = length of conductor in the field (m).

This force is maximum when the current is perpendicular to the field.
Fleming's Left-Hand Rule: point the thumb (force/motion), index finger (field), and middle finger (current) at right angles to each other.

Example: length = 1 m, current = 9 A, B = 1 T.
F = 1 × 9 × 1 = 9 N.

THE MOTOR EFFECT
An electric motor uses the force on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field. The split-ring commutator reverses current direction every half-turn to keep the coil spinning.

ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION (the generator effect)
Moving a conductor in a magnetic field (or changing the flux through a coil) induces an EMF — and a current if the circuit is complete.
Fleming's Right-Hand Rule gives the direction of induced current.
Increase EMF by: faster movement, stronger magnet, more turns on the coil.

Atom: a nucleus (protons + neutrons) surrounded by electrons in shells.
Proton: charge +1, relative mass 1.
Neutron: charge 0, relative mass 1.
Electron: charge −1, relative mass ≈ 0 (negligible).

KEY NUMBERS
Atomic number (proton number, Z): number of protons. Defines the element.
Mass number (nucleon number, A): total number of protons + neutrons.
Number of neutrons = A − Z.

Example: mass number 134, 67 neutrons → atomic number = 134 − 67 = 67.
Example: 21 protons, 36 neutrons → mass number = 21 + 36 = 57.

ISOTOPES
Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons.
Same atomic number, different mass number. E.g., ¹²C and ¹⁴C are both carbon.

RADIOACTIVE DECAY
Alpha (α) decay: emits an alpha particle (⁴₂He). A decreases by 4; Z decreases by 2.
Beta (β⁻) decay: a neutron converts to a proton + electron; emits the electron. A unchanged; Z increases by 1.
Gamma (γ) emission: high-energy electromagnetic radiation released after alpha or beta decay. A and Z unchanged.

PENETRATING POWER AND IONISATION
Alpha: stopped by paper or a few cm of air. Highly ionising. Most dangerous if inhaled.
Beta: stopped by a few mm of aluminium. Moderately ionising.
Gamma: reduced (but not stopped) by thick lead or concrete. Weakly ionising.

An object in a circular orbit travels at a constant speed but is continuously changing direction — gravity provides the centripetal force.

Example: r = 13 × 10⁶ m, T = 2 hours = 7,200 s.
v = 2π × 13 × 10⁶ ÷ 7,200 ≈ 11,345 m/s.

FACTORS AFFECTING ORBITS
Closer orbit → higher speed, shorter period.
Geostationary orbit: T = 24 h, remains above the same point on Earth. Used for communication satellites.
Low Earth orbit: lower altitude, faster, used for imaging.

THE LIFE CYCLE OF STARS
Nebula (gas and dust cloud) → Protostar (gravitational collapse) → Main sequence star (hydrogen fusion, stable for billions of years) → Red giant / red supergiant (hydrogen exhausted, expands).
Low/medium mass stars → White dwarf → Black dwarf.
High mass stars → Supernova → Neutron star or Black hole.

Our Sun is a medium-mass main sequence star.

THE UNIVERSE
Big Bang theory: the universe began ≈ 13.8 billion years ago as an extremely hot, dense point.
Evidence: cosmic microwave background radiation; red-shift of distant galaxies.
Red-shift: light from galaxies is shifted to longer wavelengths, showing they are moving away. More distant galaxies show greater red-shift → universe is expanding.

      body: `COMPLETING THE SQUARE
For x² + bx + c:
x² + bx + c = (x + b/2)² − (b/2)² + c

The value q = c − (b/2)² is the minimum value of the expression (when a = 1).

Example: x² − 4x + 11
= (x − 2)² − 4 + 11 = (x − 2)² + 7   → q = 7

Example: x² + 10x − 5
= (x + 5)² − 25 − 5 = (x + 5)² − 30  → q = −30

For ax² + bx + c (a ≠ 1): factor out a first, then complete the square inside.

USES OF COMPLETING THE SQUARE
• Finding the vertex of a parabola: y = (x − h)² + k has vertex (h, k).
• Solving quadratics: (x + b/2)² = (b/2)² − c → x = −b/2 ± √((b/2)² − c).
• Proving minimum/maximum values.

DISCRIMINANT
For ax² + bx + c = 0, the discriminant Δ = b² − 4ac determines the number of real roots.
Δ > 0: two distinct real roots.
Δ = 0: one repeated real root (tangent to the x-axis).
Δ < 0: no real roots (complex only).

PARTIAL FRACTIONS
Split a rational expression into simpler fractions before integrating or expanding.
For distinct linear factors: (3x + 1)/((x+1)(x−2)) ≡ A/(x+1) + B/(x−2).
Multiply both sides by the denominator, then substitute the roots of each factor to find A and B.

Key circle theorems (coordinate geometry versions):

• Angle in a semicircle = 90° → if AB is a diameter, ∠APB = 90° for any point P on the circle.

ln(eˣ) = x.   e^(ln x) = x.   d/dx(eˣ) = eˣ.   d/dx(ln x) = 1/x.

SOLVING EXPONENTIAL EQUATIONS
Take logs of both sides to bring the power down.
2ˣ = 15 → x ln 2 = ln 15 → x = ln 15 / ln 2 ≈ 3.91.

SOLVING EQUATIONS IN LOG FORM
Combine logs first using the laws, then convert to exponential form.

Proof by deduction: use known facts and algebra to reach the conclusion directly. Most common in A-level.
Proof by exhaustion: check every possible case (only feasible when cases are finite).
Proof by contradiction: assume the opposite of what you want to prove, derive a logical impossibility.
Disproof by counter-example: find ONE example where the statement fails. A single counter-example is sufficient to disprove a universal claim.

Example proof by deduction: "The product of two odd numbers is always odd."
Let the two odd numbers be 2m+1 and 2n+1 (m, n ∈ ℤ).
Product = (2m+1)(2n+1) = 4mn + 2m + 2n + 1 = 2(2mn+m+n) + 1.
Since 2mn+m+n is an integer, the product is of the form 2k+1 → it is odd. ∎

THE BINOMIAL THEOREM
(1 + x)ⁿ = 1 + nx + n(n−1)/2! x² + n(n−1)(n−2)/3! x³ + ...

For (a + b)ⁿ:
(a + b)ⁿ = Σ ⁿCᵣ aⁿ⁻ʳ bʳ   (r from 0 to n)

BINOMIAL COEFFICIENTS
ⁿCᵣ = n! / (r!(n−r)!)

Key values: ⁿC₀ = 1,  ⁿC₁ = n,  ⁿCₙ = 1.
Pascal's triangle gives the same coefficients row by row.

Finding a specific term: the (r+1)th term of (a+b)ⁿ is ⁿCᵣ × aⁿ⁻ʳ × bʳ.

Example: Coefficient of x¹ in (1+x)⁶.
r = 1: ⁶C₁ × 1⁵ × x¹ = 6x → coefficient = 6.

On a stress-strain graph:
• Linear region (Hooke's Law): stress ∝ strain.

COMBINED GAS LAW (fixed amount of gas)
p₁V₁/T₁ = p₂V₂/T₂

Useful for comparing two states of the same gas.

KINETIC THEORY
pV = ⅓Nm<c²>
N = number of molecules, m = mass per molecule, <c²> = mean square speed.

Internal energy of an ideal gas = total KE of all molecules.
For a monatomic ideal gas: U = (3/2)nRT.
Average KE per molecule = (3/2)k_BT, where k_B = 1.38×10⁻²³ J K⁻¹.

FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS
ΔU = Q + W
ΔU = change in internal energy, Q = heat added to system, W = work done ON the system.
(Some textbooks define W as work done BY the system: ΔU = Q − W. Check the convention used.)

SPECIFIC HEAT CAPACITY AND LATENT HEAT
Q = mcΔT (heating without change of state).

      body: `MASS-ENERGY EQUIVALENCE
E = mc²
c = 3 × 10⁸ m/s. A tiny mass defect releases an enormous amount of energy.

Working in atomic mass units (u):
1 u = 1.66 × 10⁻²⁷ kg
Energy equivalent of 1 u = 931.5 MeV.

Example: mass defect = 0.001 u.
E = 0.001 × 931.5 = 0.9315 MeV.

BINDING ENERGY
The binding energy of a nucleus is the energy required to completely separate all nucleons.
Binding energy per nucleon: peaks around iron-56 (most stable nucleus).
Fusion (light nuclei joining) and fission (heavy nuclei splitting) both release energy when the products have higher binding energy per nucleon.

RADIOACTIVE DECAY EQUATIONS
Activity: A = −dN/dt = λN
N = N₀ e^(−λt)     (exponential decay)
Half-life: t½ = ln2 / λ ≈ 0.693 / λ

After time t: N = N₀ × (½)^(t/t½)

The decay constant λ is fixed for each isotope — unaffected by temperature, pressure, or chemical state.

NUCLEAR REACTIONS

Alpha: ₂₃₈₉₂U → ₂₃₄₉₀Th + ₄₂He

      keyIdea: "Light comes in discrete packets called photons — and the photoelectric effect proves it, because classical wave theory cannot explain the threshold frequency.",
      body: `PHOTONS
Light (and all EM radiation) travels as discrete packets of energy called photons.
Energy of one photon: E = hf = hc/λ
h = Planck's constant = 6.63 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s.
f = frequency (Hz), λ = wavelength (m).

THE PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT
When light shines on a metal surface, electrons are emitted — but only if the frequency exceeds a threshold frequency f₀.

Einstein's photoelectric equation:
hf = Φ + KE_max
where Φ = work function (minimum energy to free an electron from the metal).

KE_max = hf − Φ

Work function in eV: 1 eV = 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ J.

Example: f = 0.8 × 10¹⁵ Hz, Φ = 1 eV = 1.6×10⁻¹⁹ J.
E_photon = hf = 6.63×10⁻³⁴ × 0.8×10¹⁵ = 5.30×10⁻¹⁹ J = 3.31 eV.
KE_max = 3.31 − 1 = 2.31 eV.

Key observations that classical wave theory CANNOT explain:
• Below threshold frequency f₀: no electrons emitted, regardless of intensity.
• Above f₀: electrons emitted instantly, even at low intensity.
• Increasing intensity increases the number of electrons (not their KE).
• Increasing frequency increases KE_max of emitted electrons.

WAVE-PARTICLE DUALITY
de Broglie wavelength: λ = h / (mv) = h / p
Any particle with momentum p has an associated wavelength λ.
Electrons show diffraction (wave behaviour) and can be detected as discrete particles.

      title: "States of Matter",
      keyIdea: "Everything is made of particles — whether a substance is solid, liquid, or gas depends on how those particles are arranged and how freely they move.",
      body: `Matter exists in three states: solid, liquid, and gas.

SOLID: Particles packed tightly in a regular arrangement. They vibrate in fixed positions. Solids have a definite shape and volume. Example: ice.

LIQUID: Particles close together but not fixed — they slide past each other. Liquids have a fixed volume but no fixed shape; they flow and take the shape of their container. Example: water.

GAS: Particles far apart, moving rapidly in all directions. Gases have no fixed shape or volume — they expand to fill any space. Example: water vapour, oxygen.

CHANGES OF STATE
When heated, particles gain energy and move faster, which can cause a change of state:
• Melting: solid → liquid (ice melts at 0°C)
• Evaporation/Boiling: liquid → gas (water boils at 100°C)
• Condensation: gas → liquid (steam on a cold mirror)
• Freezing: liquid → solid (water freezes at 0°C)

Changes of state are PHYSICAL changes — no new substance is made. The same water molecules are present in ice, liquid water, and steam.

THE WATER CYCLE is driven by changes of state: water evaporates from oceans, rises and condenses into clouds, then falls as precipitation (rain, snow, hail).`,

CONDUCTIVITY OF ELECTRICITY
Conductors allow electricity to flow (copper, iron, steel). Insulators do not (plastic, rubber, wood, glass). Metals are generally good conductors; non-metals are generally insulators.

CONDUCTIVITY OF HEAT
Metals conduct heat well. Materials like plastic and wood are thermal insulators — useful for handles and oven gloves.

TRANSPARENCY
• Transparent: all light passes through clearly (glass, clear plastic).
• Translucent: some light passes through but you cannot see clearly (frosted glass, tracing paper).
• Opaque: no light passes through (wood, metal, cardboard).

HARDNESS
Resistance to scratching. Diamond is the hardest natural material. Important for drill bits, floor tiles, and cutting tools.

FLEXIBILITY
Some materials bend without breaking (rubber, fabric). Others are rigid and brittle (glass, ceramic).

MAGNETISM
Only iron, steel, nickel, and cobalt are attracted to magnets. Most metals (aluminium, copper, gold) are NOT magnetic.

WATERPROOFING
Some materials let water through (cotton, sponge); others do not (rubber, plastic, wax).

A mixture is two or more substances combined but NOT chemically joined. The substances keep their own properties and can be separated physically.

A solution is a special mixture where a solute dissolves in a solvent:

• Solvent = the liquid doing the dissolving (usually water)

SOLUBLE vs. INSOLUBLE
A soluble substance dissolves in the solvent. An insoluble substance does not.
Soluble in water: salt, sugar, copper sulfate.
Insoluble in water: sand, chalk, gravel.

SATURATION
Keep adding solute and eventually no more will dissolve — the solution is saturated. Warmer water dissolves more of most solutes.

SEPARATING MIXTURES
• Filtration: separates an insoluble solid from a liquid. The solid stays on the filter paper; the liquid (filtrate) passes through.
• Evaporation: separates a dissolved solid from a solution. Heat drives off the solvent, leaving the solid behind. Used to recover salt from salt water.
• Magnetism: separates magnetic materials (iron filings) from non-magnetic substances.

      body: `THE ATOM
An atom is the smallest particle of an element that retains its chemical properties. Atoms are mostly empty space. At the centre is a tiny, dense nucleus; electrons orbit in shells around it.

SUBATOMIC PARTICLES
• Proton: in the nucleus. Relative charge = +1. Relative mass = 1.
• Neutron: in the nucleus. Relative charge = 0. Relative mass = 1.
• Electron: in shells around the nucleus. Relative charge = −1. Relative mass ≈ 0 (negligible).

ATOMIC NUMBER & MASS NUMBER
• Atomic number (proton number) = number of protons. This uniquely defines the element.
• Mass number = protons + neutrons.
• Number of neutrons = mass number − atomic number.
• In a neutral atom: number of electrons = number of protons.

ELECTRON SHELLS (KS3 rules)
• Shell 1 (innermost): up to 2 electrons.
• Shell 2: up to 8 electrons.
• Shell 3: up to 8 electrons.

ISOTOPES
Atoms of the same element with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. They have identical chemical properties but slightly different masses. Example: Carbon-12 and Carbon-14 both have 6 protons.

A pure substance made of only one type of atom. Cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical reactions. There are 118 known elements, arranged in the periodic table.

COMPOUNDS
Formed when two or more different elements are chemically bonded together in fixed ratios. The compound has different properties from the elements it contains. You cannot separate a compound by physical methods — you need a chemical reaction.

The modern periodic table lists all elements in order of increasing atomic number (protons).

PERIODS (horizontal rows)

GROUPS (vertical columns)
Elements in the same group have the same number of electrons in their outer shell — which is why they have similar chemical properties.

KEY GROUPS
• Group 1 — Alkali Metals (Li, Na, K…): 1 outer electron. Very reactive with water and air. Reactivity INCREASES down the group (outer electron is further from nucleus, more easily lost).
• Group 7 — Halogens (F, Cl, Br, I…): 7 outer electrons. Reactive non-metals. Reactivity DECREASES down the group (harder to gain one electron when the outer shell is further from the nucleus).
• Group 0 — Noble Gases (He, Ne, Ar…): Full outer shell. Very unreactive.

METALS AND NON-METALS
Metals: left and centre of the table. Non-metals: top right.

ALKALI METALS + WATER
Group 1 metals react vigorously with cold water to produce a metal hydroxide and hydrogen gas:
metal + water → metal hydroxide + hydrogen
e.g. 2Na + 2H₂O → 2NaOH + H₂
The solution formed is alkaline (hydroxide ions). Reactivity increases down Group 1.

      keyIdea: "In a chemical reaction reactants are transformed into products with different properties — and the total mass is always conserved because atoms are rearranged, not created or destroyed.",
      body: `WHAT IS A CHEMICAL REACTION?
Reactants are transformed into products. New chemical bonds form and/or old ones break. Products have different properties from the reactants.

WORD EQUATIONS
Reactants → Products
Example: magnesium + oxygen → magnesium oxide
The arrow means "produces" or "yields".

SIGNS OF A CHEMICAL REACTION
• Temperature change (heat released or absorbed)
• Light produced
• A gas evolved (bubbles)
• A precipitate (insoluble solid) forms
• A colour change that cannot be reversed
• A new smell

TYPES OF REACTION
• Combustion: substance reacts rapidly with oxygen, releasing heat and light (e.g. burning methane or wood).
• Thermal decomposition: a substance breaks down on heating (e.g. copper carbonate → copper oxide + CO₂).
• Oxidation: a substance gains oxygen. Reduction: a substance loses oxygen.
• Displacement: a more reactive metal displaces a less reactive one from its compound.
• Neutralisation: acid + alkali → salt + water.
• Precipitation: two solutions react to form an insoluble solid.

EXOTHERMIC vs. ENDOTHERMIC
• Exothermic: releases energy to surroundings — temperature rises. Examples: combustion, neutralisation.
• Endothermic: absorbs energy from surroundings — temperature falls. Examples: thermal decomposition, photosynthesis.

CONSERVATION OF MASS
Total mass of reactants = total mass of products. Atoms are rearranged, not created or destroyed.`,

      keyIdea: "The pH scale measures acidity and alkalinity — acids below 7, alkalis above 7 — and neutralisation is the reaction between an acid and a base to produce a salt and water.",
      body: `THE pH SCALE
pH measures how acidic or alkaline a solution is. Scale runs 0–14:
• pH 0–6: acidic (lower = stronger acid)
• pH 7: neutral (pure water)
• pH 8–14: alkaline (higher = stronger alkali)

Universal indicator colours: red/orange (strong acid) → yellow/green (weak acid/neutral) → blue/purple (alkali).

EXAMPLES
Acids: hydrochloric acid (HCl, stomach acid), sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), citric acid (lemons), ethanoic acid (vinegar).
Alkalis: sodium hydroxide (NaOH), bleach, baking soda, toothpaste.

NEUTRALISATION
acid + alkali → salt + water (exothermic)
• HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O (sodium chloride)
• H₂SO₄ + 2KOH → K₂SO₄ + 2H₂O (potassium sulfate)

The name of the salt formed depends on the acid used: HCl → chloride salt; H₂SO₄ → sulfate salt; HNO₃ → nitrate salt.

REACTIONS OF ACIDS
• Metal + acid → salt + hydrogen gas. Test: hydrogen burns with a squeaky pop.
• Metal carbonate + acid → salt + water + CO₂. Test: CO₂ turns limewater milky.
• Acid + alkali → salt + water (neutralisation).

BASES vs. ALKALIS
A base is any substance that neutralises an acid. An alkali is a base that dissolves in water (e.g. NaOH is both a base and an alkali; copper oxide is a base but not an alkali because it does not dissolve in water).`,

      keyIdea: "Metals and non-metals have contrasting properties — and a metal's position in the reactivity series predicts how vigorously it reacts with acids, water, and other metal compounds.",
      body: `PROPERTIES OF METALS
• Good conductors of heat and electricity
• Shiny (lustrous)
• Malleable (hammered into shapes without breaking)
• Ductile (drawn into wires)
• High melting and boiling points (except mercury — liquid at room temperature)
• Sonorous (ring when struck)

PROPERTIES OF NON-METALS
• Poor conductors of heat and electricity (graphite/carbon is an exception)
• Dull appearance
• Brittle (solid non-metals crack rather than bend)
• Often low melting points (many are gases at room temperature)

THE REACTIVITY SERIES (most to least reactive)
K > Na > Ca > Mg > Al > Zn > Fe > Ni > Sn > Pb > Cu > Ag > Au > Pt

Potassium, sodium, and calcium react vigorously with cold water. Magnesium, zinc, and iron react slowly with steam or acids. Copper, silver, and gold are largely unreactive.

DISPLACEMENT REACTIONS
A more reactive metal displaces a less reactive metal from its salt solution.
Example: Fe + CuSO₄ → FeSO₄ + Cu (iron is more reactive than copper).

OXIDATION AND CORROSION
Metals react with oxygen to form metal oxides. Iron rusts in the presence of BOTH oxygen and water. Aluminium is higher than iron in the reactivity series yet resists corrosion because a thin, protective aluminium oxide layer forms on the surface.

ALLOYS
Mixtures of a metal with one or more other elements. Harder than pure metals because differently-sized atoms disrupt the regular lattice, preventing layers from sliding.
Examples: steel (Fe + C), brass (Cu + Zn), bronze (Cu + Sn).`,
      workedExample: {

      body: `FILTRATION
Separates an insoluble solid from a liquid. Pour through filter paper: solid (residue) stays on the paper; liquid (filtrate) passes through.
Use: removing sand from water; separating a precipitate from a solution.

EVAPORATION
Separates a dissolved solid from a solution. Heat the solution; the solvent evaporates; the solid remains.
Use: recovering salt from sea water; obtaining copper sulfate crystals.

SIMPLE DISTILLATION
Separates a liquid from a solution, or two liquids with very different boiling points. The mixture is heated; vapour rises into a condenser, cools, and is collected as a pure liquid.
Use: obtaining pure water from salt water.

FRACTIONAL DISTILLATION
Separates liquids with similar (but different) boiling points using a fractionating column. Each fraction condenses at a different level and is collected separately.
Use: separating crude oil into fractions (petrol, diesel, kerosene); separating liquid air.

PAPER CHROMATOGRAPHY
Separates dissolved substances based on how far each component travels up chromatography paper in a solvent.
Rf value = distance travelled by the spot ÷ distance travelled by the solvent front. (Always ≤ 1.)
A single spot = potentially pure. Multiple spots = mixture.
Use: identifying dyes in inks; food colouring analysis; forensic testing.

CHOOSING THE RIGHT TECHNIQUE
• Insoluble solid in liquid → filtration
• Dissolved solid in solution (want the solid) → evaporation
• Dissolved solid in solution (want the liquid) → distillation
• Two liquids with different boiling points → distillation or fractional distillation
• Mixture of coloured/dissolved substances → chromatography`,

Step 2 — add water and filter: sand is insoluble and stays on the filter paper; dissolved salt passes through as a solution. Step 3 — evaporate: heat the salt solution gently; water evaporates and salt crystals remain. Each step exploits a different physical property: magnetism, solubility, and boiling point."

      title: "Atomic Structure & the Periodic Table",
      keyIdea: "Atoms have a tiny, dense nucleus of protons and neutrons surrounded by electrons in shells. The periodic table organises elements by atomic number, revealing trends in atomic radius, ionisation energy, and reactivity.",
      body: `THE ATOM
Mostly empty space. The nucleus (protons + neutrons) is tiny and dense at the centre; electrons orbit in shells. First shell: max 2; second and third shells: max 8. The atomic number (proton number) uniquely identifies an element. Mass number = protons + neutrons. In a neutral atom: electrons = protons.

ISOTOPES
Same element, different number of neutrons → different mass number, identical chemical properties (same electron configuration).

RELATIVE ATOMIC MASS (Ar)
The weighted mean mass of an atom relative to 1/12 the mass of carbon-12. Calculated from isotope abundances:
Ar = (% × mass of isotope 1) + (% × mass of isotope 2) ... all divided by 100.
Example: Cl-35 (75%) and Cl-37 (25%) → Ar = (75×35 + 25×37) ÷ 100 = (2625 + 925) ÷ 100 = 35.5.

IONS
An atom loses electrons → positive ion (e.g. Na → Na⁺, 2,8 configuration). An atom gains electrons → negative ion. Isoelectronic ions have the same electron configuration (e.g. Na⁺ and Ne both have 2,8).

PERIODIC TABLE TRENDS
Elements listed in order of increasing atomic number. Same group = same number of outer electrons = similar properties. Period number = number of occupied shells.
• Atomic radius DECREASES across a period (more protons pull electrons closer).
• First ionisation energy INCREASES across a period (greater nuclear charge holds electrons more tightly). Second ionisation energy of Na is much higher than the first — after losing one electron, Na⁺ has a stable 2,8 configuration; the next electron is in a closer shell.
• Transition metals occupy the d-block (Groups 3–12, Periods 4–7); they have variable oxidation states and form coloured compounds.

HISTORICAL MODELS
Mendeleev arranged elements by atomic mass (not atomic number) and left gaps for undiscovered elements. Thomson proposed the plum-pudding model (electrons embedded in positive material). Rutherford's gold foil experiment (alpha particles — most pass straight through, few deflect sharply) proved the nuclear model with a tiny, dense, positively charged nucleus.`,

    "Bonding & structure": {
      title: "Bonding & Structure",
      keyIdea: "Atoms bond to achieve full outer electron shells. Ionic bonding transfers electrons; covalent bonding shares electrons; metallic bonding involves a sea of delocalised electrons. The type of bonding determines a substance's properties.",
      body: `Ionic bonding occurs between metals and non-metals. The metal atom loses electrons to form a positive ion (cation); the non-metal gains electrons to form a negative ion (anion). Electrostatic attraction holds the ions together in a giant ionic lattice. Ionic compounds have high melting points (lots of energy needed to break the lattice), conduct electricity when molten or dissolved (free ions), but not when solid (ions fixed in place). Example: NaCl — Na⁺ and Cl⁻.

Covalent bonding occurs between non-metals. Atoms share pairs of electrons to achieve full outer shells. Simple molecular compounds (H₂O, CO₂, CH₄) have strong covalent bonds within molecules but only weak intermolecular forces between them — so they have low melting/boiling points. Giant covalent structures (diamond, graphite, silicon dioxide) have very high melting points because every atom is covalently bonded throughout the structure.

Diamond has each carbon bonded to four others in a rigid tetrahedral lattice — very hard, does not conduct electricity. Graphite has layers of hexagonal rings with one delocalised electron per carbon — soft (layers slide), conducts electricity. Graphene is a single layer of graphite.

Metallic bonding consists of a lattice of positive metal ions surrounded by a sea of delocalised electrons. This gives metals: high melting points (strong attraction), electrical and thermal conductivity (free electrons), and malleability (layers slide without breaking bonds).

Dot-and-cross diagrams show the outer electrons of each atom and how they are shared or transferred. Drawing these accurately is a key exam skill.

FULLERENES AND NANOTUBES
Buckminsterfullerene (C₆₀) is a simple molecular form of carbon — hollow sphere of 60 carbon atoms with weak intermolecular forces → low melting point, does not conduct electricity. Carbon nanotubes are cylindrical structures with delocalised electrons, like graphite → conduct electricity; very high strength-to-weight ratio, used in electronics and as reinforcement.

Polymers (e.g. poly(ethene)) are giant simple molecular structures — very long chains with weak intermolecular forces between chains → low melting points, do not conduct electricity.`,

      keyIdea: "The mole links measurable masses to numbers of particles. Molar ratios from balanced equations, molar volume of gases, and limiting reagents are the core calculation tools.",
      body: `MOLES AND MASSES
Moles = mass (g) ÷ Mr. One mole contains 6.02 × 10²³ particles (Avogadro's constant). The relative formula mass (Mr) is the sum of the Ar values of all atoms in the formula (e.g. H₂O: 2×1 + 16 = 18).

MOLE RATIO CALCULATIONS
In a balanced equation, coefficients give molar ratios. Steps: (1) calculate moles of known substance; (2) use ratio to find moles of unknown; (3) convert back to mass. Example: 2Mg + O₂ → 2MgO — the molar ratio Mg:MgO = 1:1.

MOLAR VOLUME OF GASES (RTP)
At room temperature and pressure (RTP), 1 mole of any gas occupies 24 dm³ (24,000 cm³).
Moles of gas = volume (dm³) ÷ 24.

LIMITING REAGENT
The reactant that is completely used up first, determining the maximum amount of product formed. To find it: calculate moles of each reactant and compare with the molar ratio from the balanced equation. The one that runs out first is limiting.

EMPIRICAL FORMULA
The simplest whole-number ratio of atoms. To find from percentage composition: (1) treat % as grams; (2) divide each by Ar; (3) divide all by the smallest value; (4) round to whole numbers.
Example: 40% C, 6.7% H, 53.3% O → C: 40/12=3.33; H: 6.7/1=6.7; O: 53.3/16=3.33 → ratio 1:2:1 → CH₂O.

PERCENTAGE YIELD
(actual yield ÷ theoretical yield) × 100. Always ≤ 100% (product loss, incomplete reaction, reversible reaction).

ATOM ECONOMY
(Mr of desired products ÷ total Mr of all products) × 100. High atom economy = less waste.

Concentration (mol/dm³) = moles ÷ volume (dm³). Convert cm³ to dm³ by dividing by 1000.`,

      keyIdea: "Acids react with bases, metals, and carbonates in predictable patterns. Electrolysis uses electricity to decompose ionic compounds, and the reactivity series predicts which reactions will occur.",
      body: `Acids produce H⁺ ions in solution; bases produce OH⁻ ions. Neutralisation: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O. pH scale: below 7 = acidic, 7 = neutral, above 7 = alkaline. Each pH unit represents a 10-fold change in H⁺ concentration.

Key acid reactions: acid + metal → salt + hydrogen; acid + metal oxide/hydroxide → salt + water; acid + metal carbonate → salt + water + CO₂. The salt's name comes from the metal and the acid's anion (hydrochloric → chloride, sulfuric → sulfate, nitric → nitrate).

The reactivity series ranks metals from most to least reactive: K, Na, Ca, Mg, Al, Zn, Fe, Cu, Au. More reactive metals displace less reactive ones from their salts in solution (displacement reactions). Metals above hydrogen react with dilute acids; those below do not.

Oxidation is loss of electrons (OIL); reduction is gain of electrons (RIG). In ionic equations for displacement: Zn + Cu²⁺ → Zn²⁺ + Cu — zinc is oxidised (loses 2e⁻), copper ion is reduced (gains 2e⁻).

Electrolysis: an ionic compound (molten or in solution) is decomposed by electrical current. At the cathode (negative), positive ions are reduced (gain electrons). At the anode (positive), negative ions are oxidised (lose electrons). In the electrolysis of brine: H₂ at cathode, Cl₂ at anode, NaOH in solution — used industrially for chlorine and hydrogen production.`,

      keyIdea: "Exothermic reactions release energy to the surroundings; endothermic reactions absorb energy. Bond breaking requires energy; bond forming releases energy. The overall energy change determines whether a reaction is exo- or endothermic.",
      body: `In any chemical reaction, existing bonds in the reactants must be broken (energy absorbed) and new bonds in the products are formed (energy released). If more energy is released forming bonds than is absorbed breaking them, the reaction is exothermic — the surroundings get hotter, temperature rises. If more energy is absorbed than released, the reaction is endothermic — the surroundings cool down.

Common exothermic reactions: combustion, oxidation, many neutralisations, respiration. Common endothermic reactions: thermal decomposition, photosynthesis, dissolving ammonium chloride in water.

Energy profile diagrams show reactants and products on an energy axis. Exothermic: products lower than reactants; activation energy is the initial hump from reactants to the transition state. Endothermic: products higher than reactants. Catalysts lower the activation energy without being consumed — they appear on the diagram as a lower hump.

Bond energy calculations: ΔH = energy in (bonds broken) − energy out (bonds formed). If ΔH is negative, exothermic; if positive, endothermic. Example: H₂ + Cl₂ → 2HCl. Bonds broken: H−H (436 kJ/mol) + Cl−Cl (243 kJ/mol) = 679 kJ. Bonds formed: 2 × H−Cl (431 kJ/mol) = 862 kJ. ΔH = 679 − 862 = −183 kJ/mol (exothermic).

      keyIdea: "Reaction rate measures how fast reactants are converted to products. It is affected by temperature, concentration, pressure (gases), surface area, and catalysts — all explained by collision theory.",
      body: `Reaction rate can be measured by monitoring the loss of a reactant or gain of a product over time — e.g., timing how long a precipitate takes to obscure a cross (disappearing cross), measuring gas volume collected, or recording mass loss as gas escapes.

Rate = change in quantity ÷ time. The gradient of a concentration–time graph gives the instantaneous rate; a steeper gradient means faster reaction.

Collision theory explains all rate factors: for a reaction to occur, particles must collide with sufficient energy (≥ activation energy) and the correct orientation.

Temperature: increasing temperature increases the kinetic energy of particles — they move faster, collide more frequently AND with greater energy. More collisions exceed the activation energy threshold, so rate increases significantly (roughly doubles per 10°C rise).

Concentration (solutions) / Pressure (gases): more particles in the same volume → more frequent collisions → faster rate.

Surface area: breaking a solid into smaller pieces exposes more surface for collision. Powders react faster than lumps of the same mass.

Catalysts: provide an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy. More particles have enough energy to react → faster rate, without the catalyst being consumed.

Activation energy: shown on an energy profile diagram as the energy barrier between reactants and transition state. Catalysts lower this barrier (shown as a lower hump) but do not change the overall ΔH.`,

      keyIdea: "Organic chemistry is the study of carbon compounds. Hydrocarbons (alkanes and alkenes) are key homologous series; crude oil is their main source. Addition and substitution reactions are central to GCSE organic chemistry.",
      body: `Carbon forms four bonds and can chain together, making an enormous variety of compounds. Hydrocarbons contain only carbon and hydrogen.

Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons (only single C−C bonds): methane CH₄, ethane C₂H₆, propane C₃H₈, butane C₄H₁₀. General formula: CₙH₂ₙ₊₂. They undergo combustion (complete → CO₂ + H₂O; incomplete → CO or soot) and substitution with halogens in UV light.

Alkenes are unsaturated (contain a C=C double bond): ethene C₂H₄, propene C₃H₆. General formula: CₙH₂ₙ. They undergo addition reactions across the double bond — bromine water is decolourised (from orange to colourless), distinguishing alkenes from alkanes. Alkenes can polymerise (addition polymerisation) to form plastics like poly(ethene).

Crude oil is a mixture of hydrocarbons separated by fractional distillation: refinery gases (short chains, lowest bp), petrol, kerosene, diesel, fuel oil, bitumen (long chains, highest bp). Shorter chains → lower boiling point, less viscous, more flammable.

Cracking converts long, less useful hydrocarbons into shorter, more useful ones. Thermal cracking (high temp, high pressure) or catalytic cracking (catalyst, lower temp) breaks C−C bonds, producing alkanes and alkenes. Alkenes from cracking are feedstock for making polymers.

Alcohols contain the −OH functional group. Ethanol (C₂H₅OH) is made by fermentation (glucose → ethanol + CO₂, using yeast) or by hydration of ethene (ethene + steam, acid catalyst). Fermentation uses renewable feedstock — an advantage for sustainability. Carboxylic acids (e.g. ethanoic acid) contain −COOH and are weak acids.

ISOMERS
Compounds with the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements. Example: butane (C₄H₁₀) has two structural isomers — n-butane (straight chain) and methylpropane (branched). Isomers have different physical properties (e.g. different boiling points).

CONDENSATION POLYMERISATION
Monomers with two functional groups join together, releasing a small molecule (usually water) each time. Example: nylon is made from a diamine and a dicarboxylic acid — each bond forms with loss of water. Different from addition polymerisation (which requires C=C double bonds and loses nothing).

HYDROGENATION OF ALKENES
Alkenes react with hydrogen (Ni catalyst, ~150°C) to form alkanes: C₂H₄ + H₂ → C₂H₆ (ethene → ethane). This is an addition reaction.`,

A pure substance is a single element or compound with a definite melting point. Impurities lower the melting point and broaden the melting range (e.g. melts over a range 78–85°C → impure). Formulations are carefully designed mixtures (medicines, fuels, paints) where each component has a specific function.

FLAME TESTS — identify metal cations
Hold a clean wire loop in the flame after dipping in the unknown solution:
• Li⁺ = crimson/red
• Na⁺ = yellow/orange (persistent — can mask other colours)
• K⁺ = lilac/violet
• Ca²⁺ = brick red
• Cu²⁺ = blue-green
Flame tests identify which metal cation is present.

NaOH PRECIPITATION TESTS — identify metal cations in solution
Add a few drops of sodium hydroxide solution:
• Cu²⁺ → blue precipitate
• Fe²⁺ → green precipitate
• Fe³⁺ → brown/rust precipitate

ANION TESTS
• Carbonate (CO₃²⁻): add dilute acid → CO₂ gas produced (turns limewater milky).
• Sulfate (SO₄²⁻): add dilute HCl, then barium chloride solution → white precipitate (BaSO₄). (Acid added first to rule out carbonate interference.)
• Halides (Cl⁻/Br⁻/I⁻): add dilute HNO₃, then silver nitrate solution → Cl⁻ = white ppt; Br⁻ = cream ppt; I⁻ = yellow ppt.

• H₂: burns with a squeaky pop.
• O₂: relights a glowing splint.
• CO₂: turns limewater milky/cloudy.
• Cl₂: bleaches damp litmus paper white.

CHROMATOGRAPHY
Rf = distance travelled by spot ÷ distance travelled by solvent front (always ≤ 1). Single spot = potentially pure; multiple spots = mixture. Rf values are constant for a substance under the same conditions — compare against known standards to identify unknowns.

      body: `EVOLUTION OF THE ATMOSPHERE
Early Earth: mainly CO₂ and water vapour from volcanic activity, with traces of methane and ammonia. As Earth cooled, water vapour condensed into oceans, dissolving much of the CO₂. Early marine organisms (cyanobacteria) and later land plants performed photosynthesis, releasing O₂. Over billions of years O₂ built up to ~21%.

Current composition: N₂ ~78%, O₂ ~21%, Ar ~1%, CO₂ ~0.04% (and rising), plus water vapour.

THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT
Greenhouse gases (CO₂, CH₄, H₂O, N₂O) absorb outgoing infrared radiation from the Earth's surface and re-emit it in all directions, warming the planet. N₂ and O₂ do NOT absorb infrared — they have symmetrical molecules that do not interact with IR. This is why CO₂ is a greenhouse gas but N₂ is not.

Enhanced greenhouse effect: burning fossil fuels (↑CO₂), agriculture and landfill (↑CH₄), deforestation → global warming → rising sea levels, melting ice caps, extreme weather, ecosystem disruption.

THE OZONE LAYER
Ozone (O₃) in the stratosphere absorbs harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun, protecting living organisms from skin cancer and DNA damage. CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons — used in old aerosols and refrigerants) break down ozone, depleting the ozone layer. CFCs have largely been phased out under the Montreal Protocol.

ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTANTS
• CO: incomplete combustion; toxic — binds irreversibly to haemoglobin, reducing blood's oxygen-carrying capacity.
• NOₓ: car engines (high temp + N₂ + O₂); causes acid rain and smog.
• SO₂: burning sulfur-containing fuels; causes acid rain (SO₂ dissolves to form sulfuric acid).
• Particulates (soot): linked to respiratory problems and cancer.

      keyIdea: "Earth's finite resources must be extracted and processed efficiently. The Haber process turns atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia for fertilisers; metals are extracted by reduction or electrolysis depending on reactivity.",
      body: `THE HABER PROCESS
The Haber process manufactures ammonia (NH3) from nitrogen and hydrogen:
N2(g) + 3H2(g) = 2NH3(g)   (exothermic, reversible)

Conditions: ~450 degrees C, ~200 atm, iron catalyst.
- Temperature: higher temperature increases rate but shifts equilibrium LEFT (less NH3), since the reaction is exothermic. ~450 degrees C balances acceptable rate with acceptable yield.
- Pressure: higher pressure shifts equilibrium RIGHT (4 mol gas to 2 mol gas, so high pressure favours NH3). 200 atm is a compromise between yield and the cost of maintaining very high pressure.
- Catalyst: iron catalyst increases rate without affecting equilibrium position.
- Recycling: unreacted N2 and H2 are recycled back into the reactor, improving overall efficiency.

Feedstocks: nitrogen from fractional distillation of liquid air; hydrogen from the reaction of natural gas (methane) with steam.

NPK FERTILISERS
Ammonia is used to make fertilisers. Plants need nitrogen to make proteins and nucleic acids (DNA). NPK fertilisers contain nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K).

METAL EXTRACTION
Metals below carbon in the reactivity series (e.g. iron, copper) can be extracted by reduction with carbon. The blast furnace reduces Fe2O3 with carbon monoxide: Fe2O3 + 3CO to 2Fe + 3CO2. Limestone removes silicate impurities as slag.
Metals above carbon (aluminium, sodium) require electrolysis - more expensive.
Copper: purified by electrolysis; also extracted via phytomining (plants) or bioleaching (bacteria) from low-grade ores.

WATER TREATMENT
Potable water (safe to drink) is not the same as pure water. River water is treated by: sedimentation, then filtration, then chlorination (kills microorganisms). Seawater requires desalination (distillation or reverse osmosis) - energy-intensive.

MATERIALS
Composite materials combine two or more materials for properties neither has alone (e.g. carbon fibre reinforced polymer: high strength + low density). Ceramics are non-metallic inorganic solids hardened by heat (e.g. glass - made mainly from silicon dioxide). Alloys (e.g. steel = iron + carbon) are harder than pure metals because different-sized atoms disrupt the regular lattice.

      keyIdea: "Sub-shell electron configurations, quantum numbers, and periodic trends in ionisation energy, atomic radius, and electronegativity — all governed by nuclear charge, shielding, and penetration.",
      body: `Electrons occupy atomic orbitals defined by four quantum numbers: principal (n), azimuthal (l), magnetic (ml), and spin (ms). No two electrons can share all four quantum numbers (Pauli exclusion). Sub-shells fill in order of increasing energy — 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d — with degenerate orbitals first occupied singly (Hund's rule). Exceptions like Cr ([Ar] 3d⁵ 4s¹) and Cu ([Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s¹) arise from the extra stability of half-filled and fully-filled d sub-shells.

Across a period, nuclear charge increases while the number of inner shielding electrons stays roughly constant, raising the effective nuclear charge (Zeff) experienced by outer electrons. This causes atomic radius to decrease and first ionisation energy to increase — with two notable dips: Mg→Al (3p is shielded by 3s electrons) and P→S (pairing in one 3p orbital creates extra electron–electron repulsion).

Successive ionisation energies increase steadily until a sharp jump when the next electron must be removed from a filled inner shell — this directly reveals the group of the element. For example, a large jump between the 3rd and 4th IE places the element in Group 3.

Down a group, additional electron shells increase shielding significantly; outer electrons are further from the nucleus and experience lower Zeff. First ionisation energies fall, atomic radii increase, and electronegativity decreases. These trends underpin Group reactivity patterns: Group 1 metals become more reactive down the group; halogens become less reactive.

Electronegativity (Pauling scale) peaks at F (4.0) and decreases down and to the left of the periodic table. It determines bond polarity, which in turn drives dipole moments, intermolecular forces, and solubility behaviour.`,

      title: "Bonding & Structure",
      keyIdea: "VSEPR, orbital hybridisation, molecular orbital theory, and Born-Haber cycles extend GCSE bonding into a quantitative, predictive framework.",
      body: `VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) predicts molecular geometry by minimising repulsion between all electron pairs (bonding and lone). Lone pairs exert greater repulsion than bonding pairs: tetrahedral (109.5°) → trigonal pyramidal (107°, one LP) → bent (104.5°, two LPs). Species like PCl₅ (trigonal bipyramidal, 120°/90°) and SF₆ (octahedral) use d orbitals for expanded octets.

Hybridisation explains geometry in terms of orbital mixing: sp³ (tetrahedral), sp² (trigonal planar, one unhybridised p for π bonding), sp (linear, two unhybridised p orbitals). Sigma bonds form from head-on overlap; pi bonds from lateral overlap of unhybridised p orbitals. Rotation is free around σ bonds but restricted around π bonds, giving rise to E/Z isomerism.

Molecular orbital (MO) theory goes further: atomic orbitals combine to form bonding and antibonding MOs. The bond order = (bonding electrons − antibonding electrons) / 2. O₂ is paramagnetic (two unpaired electrons in degenerate π* MOs) — a result MO theory predicts but Lewis structures cannot.

The Born-Haber cycle applies Hess's law to ionic compounds. Starting from elements in their standard states, the route to the ionic lattice involves: atomisation enthalpy (solid → gaseous atoms), ionisation energies (forming cations), electron affinities (forming anions), and lattice enthalpy (gaseous ions → lattice). The discrepancy between experimental and theoretical lattice enthalpies (using a purely ionic model) reveals covalent character (Fajans' rules: small, highly charged cations and large, polarisable anions increase covalent character).

Solubility trends in Group 2 sulfates and hydroxides are explained by the balance between lattice enthalpy and hydration enthalpy: larger ions have smaller lattice enthalpies but also smaller hydration enthalpies — the net effect determines solubility.`,

      keyIdea: "Gibbs energy (ΔG = ΔH − TΔS) is the master criterion for spontaneity. Born-Haber cycles, Hess's law, and bond energies provide routes to quantifying ΔH; the third law anchors entropy values.",
      body: `The first law of thermodynamics — energy is conserved — underpins enthalpy calculations. ΔH = qp (heat at constant pressure). For reactions at constant volume (bomb calorimeter), we measure ΔU; the correction to ΔH uses ΔH = ΔU + ΔngRT where Δng is the change in moles of gas.

Hess's law: ΔH for any reaction is the same regardless of the route taken. This allows construction of enthalpy cycles connecting standard enthalpies of formation, combustion, atomisation, ionisation, and hydration. Mean bond enthalpies are averages across many compounds; they give approximate (not exact) ΔH values because actual bond strengths depend on the molecular environment.

The second law: entropy of the universe increases in all spontaneous processes. ΔStotal = ΔSsystem + ΔSsurroundings where ΔSsurroundings = −ΔH/T. Combining: ΔStotal > 0 ↔ ΔG < 0 where ΔG = ΔH − TΔS (at constant T and P).

The sign combination of ΔH and ΔS determines temperature dependence of spontaneity: (−ΔH, +ΔS) always spontaneous; (+ΔH, −ΔS) never spontaneous; mixed signs give a crossover temperature T = ΔH/ΔS.

At equilibrium, ΔG = 0, giving ΔG° = −RT ln K. A large negative ΔG° (large K) means products strongly favoured at equilibrium. This bridges thermodynamics and equilibrium chemistry — changing T shifts K via the van't Hoff equation: d(ln K)/dT = ΔH°/RT².

      body: `The rate equation rate = k[A]^m[B]^n is determined experimentally — it cannot be deduced from the stoichiometric equation. Orders m and n are found by the initial rates method: doubling [A] while holding [B] constant and measuring the effect on rate. A first-order reaction gives a constant half-life (t½ = ln 2/k); second-order gives a straight line on a 1/[A] vs t plot; zero-order gives a straight line on [A] vs t.

The Arrhenius equation k = Ae^(−Ea/RT) quantifies how k depends on temperature. A (the pre-exponential factor) reflects collision frequency and orientation. A plot of ln k vs 1/T is linear with gradient −Ea/R, allowing Ea to be calculated from experimental k values at two temperatures via: ln(k₂/k₁) = (Ea/R)(1/T₁ − 1/T₂).

Reaction mechanisms consist of elementary steps. The rate-determining step (slowest) controls the overall rate law. For a proposed mechanism, the rate law predicted by the slow step must match the experimental rate equation — this is a key way to validate (or disprove) a mechanism. Intermediates appear in the mechanism but cancel from the overall equation; they are not the same as the transition state (the highest-energy point on the energy profile, which cannot be isolated).

Catalysts provide an alternative lower-Ea pathway. Homogeneous catalysts (same phase as reactants) often work by forming an intermediate with the reactant; heterogeneous catalysts (different phase) adsorb reactants onto their surface, weakening bonds. Enzymes are biological catalysts that follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics — at high substrate concentrations, the rate plateaus at Vmax as all active sites are saturated (zero-order in substrate).`,

      body: `At equilibrium, the forward and reverse rates are equal and concentrations (or partial pressures) are constant. Kc = product of [products]^stoich / product of [reactants]^stoich; Kp uses partial pressures. The two are related by Kp = Kc(RT)^Δng where Δng is the change in moles of gas. For reactions where Δng = 0, Kp = Kc.

The reaction quotient Q is calculated using current (non-equilibrium) concentrations. If Q < Kc, the reaction proceeds forward; if Q > Kc, it proceeds in reverse; if Q = Kc, the system is at equilibrium.

Temperature is the only factor that changes K. For an exothermic reaction, increasing temperature shifts equilibrium left (towards reactants), decreasing K. For endothermic reactions, K increases with temperature (van't Hoff equation: ln(K₂/K₁) = −ΔH°/R × (1/T₂ − 1/T₁)).

Pressure (for gas reactions with Δng ≠ 0) and concentration changes shift the position of equilibrium but do not change K. Catalysts do not change K or equilibrium position — they speed up attainment of equilibrium equally in both directions.

Acid-base equilibria use Ka (for weak acids), Kb (for weak bases), and Kw (= [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1×10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C). pH = −log[H⁺]; pKa = −log Ka. Buffer calculations use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]). At the half-equivalence point of a titration, pH = pKa — the most useful buffer point.

      body: `Standard electrode potentials are measured versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE, E° = 0.00 V) with all species at 1 mol/dm³ (or 1 atm for gases) and 298 K. The more positive E°, the stronger the oxidising agent (the species is easily reduced). The more negative E°, the stronger the reducing agent.

For a cell reaction to be feasible, E°cell = E°cathode − E°anode must be positive. E°cell is related to Gibbs energy by ΔG° = −nFE°cell, linking electrochemistry to thermodynamics. A positive E°cell means ΔG° < 0 — the reaction is thermodynamically spontaneous under standard conditions. However, kinetic barriers may prevent the reaction from proceeding at a measurable rate.

The Nernst equation E = E° − (RT/nF)ln Q = E° − (0.0257/n)ln Q (at 298 K) gives the actual electrode potential at non-standard concentrations. This explains why cell voltage changes as the reaction proceeds (concentrations shift) and how concentration cells generate a voltage.

Electrolysis uses an external voltage to drive non-spontaneous reactions. Faraday's first law: mass deposited ∝ charge passed (Q = It). Faraday's second law: same charge deposits moles proportional to 1/(ionic charge). The charge needed to deposit one mole of a monovalent ion is F = 96485 C/mol; for a divalent ion, 2F.

At the cathode (−): cations are reduced. At the anode (+): anions are oxidised (or the anode itself dissolves if active). In the electrolysis of aqueous solutions, competition exists between the ions and water — selective discharge depends on E° and concentration (e.g., in concentrated NaCl: Cl₂ at anode despite O₂ being thermodynamically preferred, due to overpotential and high Cl⁻ concentration).

Disproportionation (a species simultaneously oxidised and reduced) and comproportionation (two oxidation states of the same element combining to give an intermediate state) are important redox reaction types identified by tracking oxidation states.`,

      body: `Alkanes undergo free radical substitution with halogens (UV). The chain mechanism: initiation (Cl₂ → 2Cl•), propagation (Cl• + RH → R• + HCl; R• + Cl₂ → RCl + Cl•), termination (two radicals combine). The mechanism produces a mixture of mono- and polysubstituted products, so selectivity is limited.

Alkenes undergo electrophilic addition. The double bond's π electrons attract electrophiles. Addition of Br₂ proceeds via a bromonium ion intermediate — the anti addition (trans product) observed is evidence for this. Markovnikov's rule (H adds to the less substituted carbon, halide to the more substituted) is explained by carbocation stability: tertiary > secondary > primary.

Arenes (benzene and derivatives) undergo electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), not addition, because disrupting the delocalized π system (152 kJ/mol resonance energy) is thermodynamically costly. The electrophile must be activated: Br₂/FeBr₃, NO₂⁺ (from HNO₃/H₂SO₄), carbocations (Friedel-Crafts), acylium ions (Friedel-Crafts acylation).

Directing effects: electron-donating groups (OH, NH₂, alkyl) activate the ring and direct ortho/para; electron-withdrawing groups (NO₂, C=O, halogens are mildly deactivating ortho/para directors) deactivate the ring and typically direct meta (except halogens which direct ortho/para despite being deactivating).

Stereoisomerism in organic chemistry: E/Z isomers from restricted rotation around C=C; optical isomers from chiral centres (sp³ carbon with four different groups). Enantiomers have identical physical and chemical properties except optical rotation and reaction rate with chiral reagents. A racemic mixture (50:50 enantiomers) shows zero net optical rotation and is produced when achiral reagents create a chiral centre.`,

      body: `Carbonyl compounds (aldehydes and ketones) undergo nucleophilic addition at the electrophilic carbonyl carbon. Nucleophiles like CN⁻ (HCN/KCN) add to give hydroxynitriles; NaBH₄ (hydride source) reduces aldehydes to primary alcohols and ketones to secondary alcohols. Grignard reagents (RMgX) act as carbanion equivalents, adding to carbonyls to give alcohols after hydrolysis. These reactions create new C–C bonds.

Halogenoalkanes undergo nucleophilic substitution (NAS) or elimination. SN2 (second-order): concerted backside attack by the nucleophile → inversion of configuration (Walden inversion); favoured by primary alkyl halides and strong nucleophiles in polar aprotic solvents. SN1 (first-order): rate-determining ionisation to a carbocation intermediate → racemisation (attack from both faces); favoured by tertiary alkyl halides and polar protic solvents.

Competing elimination (E1 and E2) gives alkenes; favoured by bulky bases or high temperature. The order of leaving group ability: I > Br > Cl > F (bond strength decreases down the group), while C–F is the strongest (worst leaving group despite highest electronegativity).

Acyl chlorides are highly reactive towards nucleophilic acyl substitution: with water (hydrolysis to carboxylic acid), alcohols (ester), amines (amide). The mechanism involves addition to C=O followed by departure of Cl⁻ — much faster than ester hydrolysis because Cl⁻ is a far better leaving group than RO⁻.

Condensation polymers form by reaction of bifunctional monomers: polyesters (diol + dicarboxylic acid, −H₂O per linkage), polyamides (diamine + diacid, −HCl for nylon from acyl chloride route). Biodegradable polymers (e.g. polylactic acid) can be hydrolysed in the environment.`,

IR spectroscopy identifies functional groups from characteristic stretching frequencies: O–H (alcohol) broad 3200–3550 cm⁻¹; O–H (carboxylic acid) very broad 2500–3300 cm⁻¹; N–H 3100–3500 cm⁻¹; C≡N 2200 cm⁻¹; C=O (ketone) ~1715 cm⁻¹; C=O (ester) ~1735 cm⁻¹; C=O (amide) ~1680 cm⁻¹.

      body: `Transition metals (Sc–Zn) are defined by having at least one ion with a partially filled d sub-shell. This gives rise to: variable oxidation states (successive IE similar in energy for 3d/4s electrons), catalytic behaviour (variable OS allows redox cycles), coloured ions (d–d transitions absorb visible light), and complex ion formation (empty d orbitals accept lone pairs from ligands).

Crystal field theory: in an octahedral complex, ligand lone pairs approach along the axes, raising the energy of dz² and dx²−y² (the eg set) relative to dxy, dxz, dyz (the t₂g set). The energy gap Δoct determines the colour absorbed. Strong-field ligands (high in the spectrochemical series: CO > CN⁻ > NH₃ > H₂O > F⁻ > Cl⁻ > I⁻) give large Δ → absorbed light is higher energy (blue end) → complementary colour seen. They also favour low-spin configurations (electrons pair in t₂g before occupying eg).

MnO₄⁻ and CrO₄²⁻ are intensely coloured despite having d⁰ and d⁰ configurations (no d electrons for d–d transitions) — their colour arises from charge transfer (CT) transitions (O → metal), which are much more intense than d–d transitions.

The chelate effect: polydentate ligands (EDTA⁶⁻, en) form more stable complexes than equivalent monodentate ligands due to the favourable entropy change when multiple monodentate ligands are released. For example, replacing 6 H₂O with one EDTA: Δng(aqueous) → large positive ΔS → ΔG more negative.

    "Plants": {
      title: "How Plants Grow & Reproduce",
      keyIdea: "Plants make their own food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide — and reproduce by producing seeds through pollination and fertilisation.",
      body: `Plants are the base of almost every food chain because they can make their own food. This process is called photosynthesis: plants capture light energy using green chlorophyll in their leaves, absorb carbon dioxide from the air through tiny pores (stomata), and draw water up from the soil through their roots and stem. The plant uses these ingredients to make glucose (a sugar) and releases oxygen as a by-product.

Each part of the plant has a specific job:
• Roots — absorb water and minerals from the soil and anchor the plant.
• Stem — transports water upward (in xylem tubes) and sugars downward (in phloem), and supports the plant.
• Leaves — the main site of photosynthesis; flat and thin to catch maximum light.
• Flowers — responsible for reproduction.

Flowers contain the male part (stamen, which produces pollen) and the female part (pistil/carpel, which contains the ovule). Pollination is when pollen is transferred from the stamen of one flower to the stigma of another — carried by insects attracted by colourful petals and nectar, or blown by the wind. After pollination, fertilisation occurs when a pollen tube grows and the male sex cell fuses with the egg in the ovule. The fertilised ovule develops into a seed inside a fruit.

Seeds need water, warmth, and oxygen to germinate (begin growing). They do not need light at first because they use the stored food inside the seed. Plants also store excess glucose as starch — a longer-term energy store.`,
      workedExample: {
        problem: "A plant is kept in a dark cupboard for three days. A leaf is tested with iodine solution. The iodine stays brown. What does this tell us?",
        solution: "The iodine staying brown means no starch is present. Without light, the plant cannot carry out photosynthesis, so no glucose is made and therefore no starch is stored. This is a standard 'destarching' experiment — it shows photosynthesis requires light."

    "Animals including humans": {
      title: "The Human Body: Nutrition, Organs & Systems",
      keyIdea: "The human body is organised into organ systems — each with a specific role — and requires a balanced diet to keep all those systems working properly.",
      body: `Your body is made of cells organised into tissues, organs, and organ systems. Each system does a different job, and they work together to keep you alive.

The digestive system breaks food down into small molecules that can be absorbed into the blood. It runs from the mouth (where teeth chew and saliva begins breaking down starch) through the oesophagus, stomach, small intestine (where most nutrients are absorbed) and large intestine (where water is absorbed) to the rectum and anus.

The circulatory system delivers nutrients and oxygen to every cell. The heart pumps blood around two circuits: one to the lungs (to pick up oxygen) and one to the rest of the body. Arteries carry blood away from the heart; veins bring it back; tiny capillaries allow exchange with body cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen using haemoglobin; white blood cells fight infection.

The skeletal and muscular systems work together — muscles pull on bones via tendons to create movement. The skeleton also protects vital organs (the skull protects the brain; ribs protect the heart and lungs) and makes blood cells in the bone marrow.

A balanced diet provides: carbohydrates (energy), proteins (growth and repair), fats (energy storage and insulation), vitamins and minerals (e.g. Vitamin C for immunity, Vitamin D for bones, iron for haemoglobin, calcium for bones), water (all chemical reactions in the body need water), and fibre (to keep the digestive system moving).`,
      workedExample: {
        problem: "A child's diet is very low in Vitamin D and calcium. What health problems might they develop?",
        solution: "Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium from food. Without enough of either, bones do not harden properly. Children can develop rickets — soft, weak, bowed bones. Adults may develop osteomalacia (soft bones). The fix is more dairy, oily fish, eggs, and exposure to sunlight (which triggers Vitamin D production in the skin)."

    "Living things & their habitats": {
      title: "Habitats, Food Chains & Classification",
      keyIdea: "All living things are adapted to their environment, interact through food chains and webs, and can be grouped by their characteristics.",
      body: `A habitat is the natural environment where an organism lives. It provides everything that organism needs: food, water, shelter, and mates. Different habitats (woodland, pond, seashore, desert) support very different communities of organisms because the conditions — temperature, light, moisture — vary greatly.

Organisms are classified into groups based on shared characteristics. The main groups of vertebrates (animals with a backbone) are: fish (breathe with gills, lay eggs in water, cold-blooded), amphibians (live in water and land, moist skin, cold-blooded), reptiles (dry scaly skin, cold-blooded), birds (feathers, warm-blooded, lay hard-shelled eggs), and mammals (fur or hair, warm-blooded, feed young on milk). Invertebrates (no backbone) include insects (6 legs), spiders (8 legs), worms, snails, and many others.

Food chains show how energy passes from producers (plants, which make food via photosynthesis) through primary consumers (herbivores), secondary consumers (carnivores that eat herbivores), and tertiary consumers (top predators). Arrows show the direction of energy flow. For example: grass → rabbit → fox → eagle.

Decomposers (bacteria and fungi) break down dead organisms and return nutrients to the soil — they are essential for recycling and are part of every ecosystem.

Adaptation means an organism has features that suit it to its environment. A polar bear has thick white fur (insulation + camouflage), small ears (reduce heat loss), and large feet (spread weight on ice). A cactus has thick stems (water storage), spines (reduced leaf surface area to reduce water loss), and deep roots.`,

        problem: "In a pond ecosystem: algae → water fleas → small fish → large fish. The small fish population suddenly decreases due to disease. Predict what happens to the water flea population and the large fish population.",
        solution: "Water flea numbers would INCREASE — fewer small fish eating them. Large fish numbers would DECREASE — less food available. This is a classic predator-prey interaction. In reality, over time, more large fish would die, fewer water fleas would be eaten, algae might decrease as more water fleas eat them, and eventually the system would tend back towards balance."

    "Evolution & inheritance": {
      title: "Evolution, Inheritance & Natural Selection",
      keyIdea: "Offspring inherit characteristics from their parents through genes; natural selection causes populations to change over many generations as better-adapted individuals survive and reproduce more.",
      body: `Inheritance is the passing of characteristics from parents to their offspring through genes — sections of DNA found on chromosomes in the nucleus of every cell. This is why children resemble their parents but are not identical to them: they inherit a combination of genes from both parents.

Variation exists within every species: no two individuals (except identical twins) are exactly alike. Some variation is inherited (eye colour, blood group) and some is caused by the environment (a scar, a suntan). Most characteristics are influenced by both.

Charles Darwin, after observing thousands of species on his voyage on HMS Beagle (especially the finches of the Galápagos Islands), proposed the theory of evolution by natural selection. His reasoning:
1. There is variation within populations.
2. Resources are limited, so there is competition for survival.
3. Some individuals have variations that make them better adapted to their environment.
4. These individuals are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass their advantageous traits to offspring.
5. Over many generations, the frequency of useful traits increases — the population evolves.

Fossils (preserved remains or traces of ancient organisms found in rock) provide evidence that species have changed over time. Selective breeding is different: humans deliberately choose which organisms to breed in order to produce offspring with desired traits — bigger fruit, more milk, faster horses.

A species becomes extinct when all its members die and no offspring remain. Human activities (habitat destruction, hunting, pollution, climate change) have greatly accelerated extinction rates.`,
      workedExample: {
        problem: "A population of moths lives in a forest. Most moths are pale (hard to see on pale bark). A factory opens and soot turns the bark dark. Over 30 years, most moths become dark. Explain this using natural selection.",
        solution: "Before pollution: pale moths were camouflaged on pale bark → less likely to be eaten by birds → more likely to survive and reproduce → pale allele passed on. After soot darkens bark: pale moths become visible to birds → eaten more → fewer survive to reproduce. Dark moths are now better camouflaged → survive more → pass on dark allele. Over generations, dark moth allele becomes more frequent in the population. This is natural selection acting on an existing variation."
      },
      commonMistakes: [
        "Saying organisms 'decide' or 'try' to adapt — individuals do not choose to change; natural selection acts on random variation that already exists.",
        "Confusing evolution (change in populations over generations) with individual change during a lifetime — a giraffe does not grow a longer neck; long-necked giraffes were always there and survived better.",
        "Thinking selective breeding = natural selection — selective breeding is done deliberately by humans; natural selection happens automatically in nature."
      ],
      keyFacts: [

    "Cells & organisation": {
      title: "Cells, Microscopy & Organisation",
      keyIdea: "All living things are made of cells; different cell types are specialised for their function; cells are organised into tissues, organs and organ systems.",
      body: `The cell is the basic unit of life. All cells share some features: a cell membrane (controls entry/exit of substances), cytoplasm (where chemical reactions occur), and DNA (genetic information). Animal cells and plant cells differ: plant cells additionally have a rigid cell wall made of cellulose (for support), chloroplasts (for photosynthesis), and a large permanent vacuole (stores cell sap, maintains turgor).

Key organelles and their functions:
• Nucleus — contains chromosomes (DNA); controls cell activities.
• Mitochondria — site of aerobic respiration; release energy (ATP) from glucose.
• Ribosomes — site of protein synthesis.
• Chloroplasts (plant only) — contain chlorophyll; site of photosynthesis.
• Cell vacuole (large in plant cells) — stores water and dissolved substances; maintains cell shape.

Specialised cells are adapted for their function:
• Red blood cells — biconcave disc (large surface area); no nucleus (more room for haemoglobin); carry O₂.
• Root hair cells — long extensions (large surface area) for absorbing water and minerals.
• Muscle cells — many mitochondria (energy for contraction); contain contractile proteins.
• Sperm cells — streamlined; long tail (flagellum) powered by many mitochondria; acrosome to penetrate egg.

Substances move between cells by diffusion (net movement of particles from high to low concentration), osmosis (net movement of water through a semi-permeable membrane from high water concentration to low), and active transport (movement against a concentration gradient, requiring energy).

Organisation: cells → tissues → organs → organ systems → organism.`,

        problem: "A student places red blood cells into a very concentrated salt solution. The cells shrink and become crenated. Explain why using osmosis.",
        solution: "In concentrated salt solution, the water concentration outside the cell is lower than inside the cell. By osmosis, water moves down its concentration gradient — out of the cell, through the partially permeable cell membrane. The cell loses water and shrinks (crenates). If placed in pure water, the opposite would happen: water would move in and the cell would swell."

    "Nutrition & digestion": {
      title: "Digestion, Enzymes & Nutrition",
      keyIdea: "Digestion breaks down large insoluble food molecules into small soluble ones that can be absorbed — enzymes are the biological catalysts that make this possible.",
      body: `Food contains large insoluble molecules (starch, proteins, fats) that must be broken down into small soluble molecules (glucose, amino acids, fatty acids + glycerol) that can pass through the gut wall into the blood. This is the job of digestion, which has two components: mechanical digestion (teeth, stomach churning) and chemical digestion (enzymes).

Enzymes are biological catalysts — proteins that speed up specific chemical reactions without being used up. Each enzyme has an active site with a specific shape; only the correct substrate fits ('lock and key' model). Key digestive enzymes:
• Amylase — digests starch → maltose/glucose. Found in saliva and pancreatic juice. Works best at pH 7.
• Protease (e.g. pepsin) — digests proteins → amino acids. Pepsin in the stomach works best at pH 2 (acidic).
• Lipase — digests fats → fatty acids + glycerol. Works in the small intestine.

Bile, produced by the liver and stored in the gall bladder, is not an enzyme — it emulsifies fat (breaks large fat droplets into smaller ones), greatly increasing the surface area for lipase to act on.

The optimum temperature for most human enzymes is around 37°C (body temperature). Above about 45°C, enzymes are denatured — the heat changes the shape of the active site so the substrate no longer fits. Activity also falls sharply at very low temperatures (enzyme and substrate molecules move more slowly).

Food tests: starch → iodine turns blue-black; reducing sugars → Benedict's solution turns brick-red on heating; protein → Biuret reagent turns purple; fats → ethanol test (cloudy emulsion with water).

Absorption mainly occurs in the small intestine. Villi (finger-like projections) massively increase surface area. Each villus has a good blood supply (capillaries) and lacteals (for fat absorption).`,

        solution: "At 20°C: some activity, but slow — molecules have less kinetic energy so fewer enzyme–substrate collisions per second. At 37°C: maximum activity — this is the optimum temperature for most human enzymes. At 55°C: activity sharply lower — enzyme beginning to denature; active site shape distorted; fewer substrate molecules can bind. At 80°C: no activity — enzyme fully denatured; active site permanently changed; substrate cannot bind at all."

    "Reproduction": {
      title: "Sexual & Asexual Reproduction",
      keyIdea: "Sexual reproduction involves two parents and produces genetically varied offspring via fertilisation; asexual reproduction involves one parent and produces genetically identical clones.",
      body: `Reproduction ensures continuation of a species. There are two fundamental types:

Asexual reproduction involves one parent — no fertilisation. All offspring are genetically identical to the parent (clones). Examples: binary fission in bacteria, budding in yeast, runners in strawberry plants, bulbs in daffodils. Advantages: fast, requires no mate, all offspring can reproduce. Disadvantage: no genetic variation — a disease can wipe out all individuals.

Sexual reproduction involves two parents. Male and female gametes (sex cells) fuse in fertilisation to produce a zygote. Gametes are produced by meiosis and contain half the normal chromosome number (haploid: 23 in humans). When two gametes fuse, the full chromosome number is restored (diploid: 46 in humans). The resulting offspring have a unique combination of genetic material from both parents — genetic variation.

In humans: eggs are produced in the ovaries; sperm in the testes. Fertilisation normally occurs in the oviduct (fallopian tube). The zygote divides and implants in the uterus wall. The placenta develops to allow exchange of nutrients, oxygen, and waste between mother and fetus (without blood mixing). The human gestation period is approximately 9 months.

In plants: pollination transfers pollen from anther (male) to stigma (female). Insect-pollinated flowers are large, colourful, scented with nectar. Wind-pollinated flowers have feathery stigmas, large amounts of light pollen, and no petals/scent. After fertilisation, the ovule becomes a seed and the ovary becomes a fruit. Seeds are dispersed by wind, water, animals (fur/eating), or explosive mechanisms.`,

      title: "Respiration & Gas Exchange",
      keyIdea: "Respiration releases energy from glucose in every living cell; aerobic respiration uses oxygen and is more efficient; gas exchange in the lungs moves O₂ into the blood and CO₂ out.",
      body: `Respiration is not breathing — it is the chemical process in every cell that releases energy (as ATP) from glucose. It occurs in the mitochondria (for aerobic respiration).

Aerobic respiration (with oxygen):
glucose + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water (+ energy)
C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O

This releases approximately 36–38 molecules of ATP per glucose — very efficient.

Anaerobic respiration (without oxygen):
In animal muscle cells: glucose → lactic acid (+ small amount of energy)
In yeast: glucose → ethanol + carbon dioxide (+ small amount of energy)

Anaerobic respiration is much less efficient (only 2 ATP per glucose) and in animals produces lactic acid, which causes muscle fatigue and soreness. Lactic acid must be broken down after exercise using extra oxygen — this is called the oxygen debt.

Gas exchange in the lungs happens in the alveoli. They are adapted with: a very large surface area (approximately 70 m² in an adult), very thin walls (one cell thick), a moist lining (gases dissolve before diffusing), and a dense capillary network. Oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the blood; carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the alveoli to be exhaled.

Breathing (ventilation) moves air in and out. During inhalation: the diaphragm contracts and flattens, intercostal muscles contract raising the ribs, thorax volume increases, pressure inside drops below atmospheric, and air flows in.

Fermentation by yeast is used in baking (CO₂ makes dough rise) and brewing (ethanol production).`,

        solution: "During the sprint: oxygen demand in leg muscles exceeded supply. Anaerobic respiration: glucose → lactic acid + energy. Only a small amount of ATP produced. Lactic acid builds up causing burning sensation (muscle fatigue). After the race: she breathes heavily — increased breathing rate and depth delivers more oxygen to the muscles. This extra oxygen is used to break down lactic acid (oxidise it back to CO₂ and water). This is repaying the oxygen debt. Heart rate also remains elevated to deliver oxygen-rich blood to muscles."

    "Photosynthesis": {
      title: "Photosynthesis & Limiting Factors",
      keyIdea: "Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose — the rate is controlled by whichever factor (light, CO₂, temperature) is in shortest supply.",
      body: `Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy stored as glucose. It occurs in chloroplasts, which contain the green pigment chlorophyll that absorbs light (mostly red and blue wavelengths — green is reflected, hence the green colour of plants).

The equation: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

Plants use glucose for: respiration (releasing energy for growth and movement), making cellulose (cell walls), making starch (energy storage), making proteins (when combined with nitrogen and minerals from soil), and making fats/oils (seeds).

The rate of photosynthesis is affected by three main limiting factors — any one of them can be the 'bottleneck':
• Light intensity — more light = more photosynthesis, up to a point. Beyond the light saturation point, other factors become limiting.
• Carbon dioxide concentration — more CO₂ = faster photosynthesis, up to a limit.
• Temperature — higher temperature increases enzyme activity, speeding up the reaction, up to the optimum (~25–30°C for most plants). Above this, enzymes are denatured and rate falls.

The compensation point is the light intensity at which the rate of photosynthesis exactly equals the rate of respiration — net gas exchange is zero.

Leaf structure is optimised for photosynthesis: palisade mesophyll (many chloroplasts, near top surface for maximum light), spongy mesophyll (air spaces for CO₂ diffusion), stomata controlled by guard cells (open in light, close in dark to reduce water loss), waxy cuticle (waterproofing), xylem (water delivery), phloem (glucose export).`,

        solution: "(a) Oxygen gas — the product of photosynthesis. (b) Light intensity decreases with the square of the distance from the lamp (inverse square law). Less light energy available → fewer photosynthesis reactions per second → fewer O₂ bubbles.

      keyIdea: "Ecosystems are communities of organisms interacting with each other and their non-living environment; energy flows through food chains and matter is cycled by processes including respiration, photosynthesis, and decomposition.",
      body: `An ecosystem includes all the living organisms (the community) and the non-living environment (abiotic factors: temperature, light, water, pH, soil) in a given area. A community is all the populations (groups of one species) in an area interacting together.

Energy enters most ecosystems as light (captured by producers via photosynthesis). It passes along food chains: producer → primary consumer → secondary consumer → tertiary consumer. At each step, approximately 90% of energy is lost (used in respiration, movement, heat, and passed in undigested faeces). This is why food chains rarely have more than 4–5 steps, and why eating lower in the food chain is more energy-efficient.

A pyramid of biomass shows the dry mass of organisms at each trophic level — it should always be wider at the bottom (producers) because most biomass is lost at each step. Unlike numbers pyramids, biomass pyramids are almost always a true pyramid shape.

The carbon cycle: carbon (as CO₂) is removed from the atmosphere by photosynthesis → stored as organic molecules → released back by respiration (all organisms), decomposition (bacteria and fungi breaking down dead organisms), combustion (burning fossil fuels and wood). Fossil fuels are formed from organisms that died millions of years ago — burning them rapidly releases carbon that was locked away for millions of years, raising atmospheric CO₂ levels and contributing to climate change.

Interactions between species: competition (same or different species competing for food, water, space, mates), predation (predator-prey cycles), and mutualism (both species benefit, e.g. bees and flowers).

Ecological fieldwork: quadrats (sampling stationary organisms — plants, barnacles) and mark-release-recapture (estimating mobile animal populations).`,

      keyIdea: "Characteristics are inherited via genes on chromosomes; dominant and recessive alleles determine phenotype; Punnett squares predict the probability of offspring inheriting particular traits.",
      body: `DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a double-helix molecule found in the nucleus. It is organised into chromosomes — human body cells have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs). Each chromosome carries many genes, each gene being a section of DNA that codes for a specific protein (which determines a characteristic).

Alleles are different versions of the same gene. For example, the gene for eye colour may have a 'brown' allele and a 'blue' allele. An organism has two alleles of each gene (one from each parent). If both alleles are the same, the organism is homozygous. If different, it is heterozygous.

An allele is dominant if it is expressed whenever it is present (even with one copy). A recessive allele is only expressed when two copies are present (homozygous recessive). We write dominant alleles as capital letters (B) and recessive as lower case (b).

Genotype: the alleles an organism has (e.g. Bb).
Phenotype: the observable characteristics (e.g. brown eyes).

A Punnett square predicts the probability of offspring genotypes and phenotypes. For two carriers of cystic fibrosis (Ff × Ff): offspring probabilities are FF (25%, unaffected), Ff (50%, carrier), ff (25%, affected).

Variation in a population can be:
• Discontinuous — distinct categories, no intermediate values (e.g. blood group A, B, AB, O; tongue rolling).
• Continuous — range of values (e.g. height, mass, skin tone).

Mutations are random changes in the DNA base sequence. Most mutations have no effect; some are harmful; very rarely, a mutation is beneficial. UV radiation and some chemicals increase mutation rates.

Sex determination: females have XX chromosomes; males have XY. The Y chromosome from the father determines male sex.`,

      keyIdea: "All living things are made of cells; eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells differ in structure; mitosis produces identical cells; substances move by diffusion, osmosis and active transport.",
      body: `Eukaryotic cells (animals, plants, fungi) have a true nucleus enclosed by a nuclear membrane and membrane-bound organelles. Prokaryotic cells (bacteria) have no nucleus — their DNA floats free in the cytoplasm, often as a circular chromosome. Bacteria may also carry small circular DNA rings called plasmids, and their ribosomes are smaller (70S vs 80S in eukaryotes).

Key organelles: nucleus (DNA control centre), mitochondria (aerobic respiration/ATP), ribosomes (protein synthesis), cell membrane (phospholipid bilayer — selectively permeable), endoplasmic reticulum (transport network), Golgi apparatus (modification and packaging of proteins). Plant cells additionally have: cell wall (cellulose), chloroplasts, and large permanent vacuole.

Magnification: magnification = image size ÷ actual size. Resolution is the ability to distinguish two nearby points as separate — electron microscopes have far greater resolution (~0.1 nm vs ~200 nm for light microscopes), revealing ultrastructure.

The cell cycle: Interphase (G1 → S phase: DNA replication → G2) then Mitosis (Prophase → Metaphase → Anaphase → Telophase → Cytokinesis). Mitosis produces two genetically identical daughter cells for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction. Cancer is uncontrolled cell division when the cell cycle regulatory mechanisms fail.

Surface area to volume ratio (SA:V): as cells get larger, their volume increases faster than their surface area. A high SA:V ratio allows efficient diffusion to supply all parts of the cell. Large organisms have a small SA:V and need specialised exchange surfaces (alveoli, villi) and transport systems.

Transport across membranes: diffusion (net movement of particles from high to low concentration — no energy); osmosis (net movement of water through a semi-permeable membrane from high water potential to low — no energy); active transport (movement against a concentration gradient using ATP, e.g. mineral ion uptake in root hair cells).

Stem cells are undifferentiated cells capable of self-renewal and differentiation. Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent (can become any cell type). Adult stem cells are multipotent (limited range). Therapeutic cloning involves creating an embryo genetically identical to a patient to harvest stem cells for treatment without immune rejection.`,

      body: `Organisation hierarchy: cells → tissues → organs → organ systems → organism.

The human digestive system: mouth (mechanical digestion by teeth; salivary amylase begins starch digestion) → oesophagus (peristalsis moves food) → stomach (HCl creates acid environment pH 2; pepsin digests protein; churning) → small intestine (most chemical digestion; enzymes from pancreas — amylase, protease, lipase; bile from liver emulsifies fat; villi maximise absorption) → large intestine (water reabsorption) → rectum/anus (egestion of faeces). Enzymes have optimal pH and temperature; denaturation occurs above the optimum temperature.

The circulatory system is a double circulation: pulmonary circuit (heart → lungs → heart) and systemic circuit (heart → body → heart). The heart is a double pump: right side pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs; left side pumps oxygenated blood to the body. The left ventricle has a thicker wall because it must generate higher pressure to push blood around the entire body. Blood vessels: arteries (thick muscular walls, small lumen, high pressure, carry blood AWAY from heart), veins (thinner walls, large lumen, valves to prevent backflow, carry blood TOWARDS heart), capillaries (one-cell thick, site of exchange between blood and tissues).

Blood components: red blood cells (biconcave, no nucleus, packed with haemoglobin — carry O₂); white blood cells (phagocytes engulf pathogens; lymphocytes produce antibodies); platelets (clotting); plasma (liquid — transports dissolved substances: glucose, CO₂, urea, hormones).

Coronary heart disease: fatty deposits (plaques) in coronary arteries reduce blood flow to heart muscle. Treated by: stents (mesh tubes to hold artery open), bypass surgery, or statins (lower LDL cholesterol).

Transport in plants: xylem (dead hollow vessels, lignified walls, carries water and minerals upward — transpiration stream); phloem (living cells, carries dissolved sugars up and down — translocation). Transpiration rate increases with temperature, light intensity, wind speed; decreases with high humidity. Guard cells control stomata — open in light (K⁺ ions enter, water follows by osmosis, cells become turgid, stomata open); close in dark.`,

      keyIdea: "Pathogens cause communicable diseases; the immune system fights infection via specific antibody production and memory cells; vaccination exploits this; drugs must be rigorously tested before use.",
      body: `Pathogens are microorganisms that cause disease. The four main types are: bacteria (e.g. Salmonella food poisoning, Gonorrhoea), viruses (e.g. Measles, HIV, Influenza, COVID-19), fungi (e.g. Rose black spot in plants, Athlete's foot), and protists (e.g. Malaria caused by Plasmodium — spread by Anopheles mosquitoes).

Bacteria cause damage by producing toxins; viruses cause damage by replicating inside and destroying host cells.

The body has non-specific defences (barriers that stop pathogens entering): skin (physical barrier, sebum inhibits microbe growth), mucus and cilia in airways (trap and sweep pathogens out), hydrochloric acid in stomach (kills pathogens in food). Once a pathogen enters, the immune system responds specifically.

Immune response: phagocytes engulf and destroy pathogens (non-specific). Lymphocytes produce specific antibodies that bind to antigens on the pathogen's surface. Antibodies have a complementary shape to specific antigens (highly specific). Antibodies can: neutralise toxins, flag pathogens for destruction, cause pathogens to clump (agglutination). Memory cells remain after infection — on re-exposure, they rapidly produce antibodies, preventing illness (this is why you become immune).

Vaccination introduces antigens (in a weakened, dead, or modified form) without causing disease — the immune system produces memory cells. Herd immunity occurs when enough individuals are vaccinated that the pathogen cannot spread.

Antibiotics kill bacteria (by targeting bacterial cell walls or ribosomes) but have NO effect on viruses. Overuse leads to antibiotic resistance by natural selection. Antiviral drugs (e.g. antiretrovirals for HIV) are harder to develop as viruses use host cell machinery.

Monoclonal antibodies: produced by fusing lymphocytes with tumour cells (hybridomas) to create cells that divide indefinitely and produce identical antibodies. Used in: pregnancy tests, cancer treatment (targeted delivery of cytotoxic drugs), diagnosis of disease.

Drug development: discovery → pre-clinical testing (cells, tissues, animals) → clinical trials (Phase 1: safety/dosage in small group; Phase 2: larger group; Phase 3: double-blind randomised control trial vs placebo) → peer review → approval.`,

        problem: "Explain why a person who has had measles is unlikely to get it again, and why vaccines work on the same principle.",
        solution: "During the initial measles infection, lymphocytes produce antibodies specific to measles antigens. After the infection is cleared, memory cells remain in the blood. On re-exposure to measles, these memory cells rapidly proliferate and produce large quantities of antibodies very quickly — before the pathogen can multiply enough to cause illness. Vaccines work identically: they introduce measles antigens (in weakened/inactivated form) to stimulate the same immune response and memory cell production, without the person ever suffering the disease."

      body: `Photosynthesis equation: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂. Occurs in chloroplasts containing chlorophyll (absorbs red and blue wavelengths; reflects green). Two stages:

1. Light-dependent reactions (thylakoid membranes): light splits water (photolysis — 2H₂O → 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ + O₂); oxygen released as by-product; ATP and NADPH produced.

2. Light-independent reactions / Calvin cycle (stroma): CO₂ fixed using ATP and NADPH to produce G3P, then glucose. Three limiting factors — light intensity, CO₂ concentration, temperature — any one of which can be the 'bottleneck' at a given moment. Increasing a limiting factor increases rate until a different factor becomes limiting.

Glucose uses: respiration (energy), cellulose (cell walls), starch (storage), proteins (combine with nitrate ions), fats/oils.

Aerobic respiration equation: C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + ~36–38 ATP. Occurs in mitochondria. Supplies energy for: active transport, protein synthesis, cell division, movement, maintaining body temperature.

Anaerobic respiration (no O₂): in animals: glucose → lactic acid (2 ATP). In yeast/plants: glucose → ethanol + CO₂ (2 ATP). Far less efficient than aerobic. Lactic acid causes muscle fatigue; repaid via oxygen debt — extra O₂ oxidises lactic acid to CO₂ and water after exercise.

Response to exercise: heart rate, breathing rate and tidal volume all increase — delivering more O₂ and removing more CO₂. Glycogen stored in muscles is hydrolysed to glucose as fuel.

Commercial applications of fermentation: brewing (ethanol from yeast), baking (CO₂ from yeast raises dough), biogas/biofuel production. Optimising fermenters requires controlling temperature, pH, and substrate concentration.`,

      body: `Homeostasis is the regulation of internal conditions — including temperature (37°C), blood glucose, and water balance — within narrow ranges, using negative feedback mechanisms. A change from the set point triggers a corrective response that reverses the change.

The nervous system provides rapid, specific, short-duration responses. Pathway: stimulus → receptor → sensory neurone → CNS (brain/spinal cord) → relay neurone → motor neurone → effector (muscle/gland). Reflex arcs (spinal cord, no conscious brain involvement) are rapid automatic responses to danger. Nerve impulses pass along axons; at synapses, neurotransmitter chemicals diffuse across the gap and bind to receptors on the next neurone, triggering a new impulse.

Thermoregulation (by the hypothalamus): if too hot → vasodilation (skin blood vessels dilate, more heat radiated), sweating (evaporation removes heat), hairs lie flat; if too cold → vasoconstriction (less heat lost), shivering (muscle contractions generate heat), hairs erect (trap insulating air).

Blood glucose control (by the pancreas): after a meal → blood glucose rises → β cells secrete insulin → cells take up glucose → liver converts glucose to glycogen → blood glucose falls (negative feedback). During fasting → blood glucose falls → α cells secrete glucagon → liver breaks down glycogen to glucose → blood glucose rises. Type 1 diabetes: insulin not produced (autoimmune destruction of β cells); treated with insulin injections. Type 2: cells become insulin resistant; managed with diet, exercise, and metformin.

Water balance (ADH): if blood too concentrated → pituitary releases ADH → kidney tubules more permeable → more water reabsorbed → small volume of concentrated urine.

The menstrual cycle is controlled by four hormones: FSH (follicle stimulating hormone — follicle maturation), LH (luteinising hormone — triggers ovulation), oestrogen (thickens uterus lining, inhibits FSH), progesterone (maintains lining). Fertility treatments use FSH to stimulate egg production; contraceptive pill uses oestrogen/progesterone to inhibit FSH and prevent ovulation.`,

Blood glucose would remain dangerously high (hyperglycaemia), damaging blood vessels, kidneys and eyes.

      title: "Inheritance, Variation & Evolution: Genetics to Natural Selection",
      keyIdea: "DNA carries the genetic code; Mendelian inheritance predicts offspring ratios; evolution by natural selection changes allele frequencies over time; genetic engineering allows targeted transfer of genes.",
      body: `DNA structure: double helix of two nucleotide strands held together by complementary base pairing (A–T, C–G). Each codon (triplet of bases) codes for one amino acid; the sequence of amino acids determines protein structure and function. Chromosomes are condensed DNA-protein complexes; humans have 46 (23 pairs) in body cells.

Protein synthesis: transcription (DNA → mRNA in nucleus) then translation (mRNA → ribosome; tRNA brings amino acids matching codons; polypeptide chain assembled). Mutations in DNA change the base sequence, potentially altering the protein produced.

Inheritance: dominant alleles are expressed with one copy; recessive alleles are only expressed homozygously. Punnett squares predict offspring ratios. Sex-linked traits are on the X chromosome — males (XY) only have one copy, so a single recessive allele is expressed (e.g. colour blindness, haemophilia).

Examples: Cystic fibrosis (ff — recessive; Ff = carrier; FF = unaffected); Polydactyly (D_ — dominant). For a genetic cross Ff × Ff: offspring ratios FF:Ff:ff = 1:2:1 (phenotype ratio affected:unaffected = 1:3).

Evolution by natural selection: random mutations create variation → competition for limited resources → individuals with advantageous alleles are more likely to survive and reproduce → pass alleles to offspring → allele frequency increases over generations. Speciation occurs when populations are geographically isolated, accumulate different mutations, and eventually cannot interbreed.

Genetic engineering: restriction enzymes cut out the desired gene from donor DNA; ligase enzymes insert it into a plasmid (vector); the plasmid is introduced into a host bacterium; the host expresses the gene. Examples: GM bacteria producing human insulin, crops resistant to herbicides or pests.

Evidence for evolution: fossils (morphological change over time), comparative anatomy (homologous structures), DNA sequence similarity, antibiotic resistance in real-time.`,

         X^H      X^h
X^H  [ X^H X^H | X^H X^h ]

(b) Daughters: X^H X^H (unaffected) and X^H X^h (carrier) — so 50% of daughters are carriers, 50% unaffected. No daughters have haemophilia (they always get at least one X^H from dad).
(c) Sons: X^H Y (unaffected) and X^h Y (haemophilia) — 50% of sons have haemophilia.
Overall probability of a child having haemophilia = 25% (1 in 4 of all children).`

      title: "Ecology: Ecosystems, Cycles & Human Impact",
      keyIdea: "Ecosystems function through energy flow and nutrient cycling; human activity disrupts these systems; understanding ecology underpins conservation and sustainable development.",
      body: `An ecosystem includes all organisms (community) and abiotic factors (temperature, light, water, pH, mineral ions) in an area. Populations interact through competition (for food, space, mates, light) and predation. Population size is influenced by biotic factors (food, predation, disease, competition) and abiotic factors. Predator-prey cycles show interdependence.

Energy transfer: solar energy → producers (photosynthesis) → primary consumers → secondary consumers → tertiary consumers. At each trophic level ~90% of energy is lost (respiration, heat, excretion, undigested material). This means biomass decreases at each level — pyramids of biomass are always pyramid-shaped. Food chains rarely exceed 4–5 steps. Eating lower in the food chain is more energy-efficient and land-efficient.

Carbon cycle: CO₂ removed by photosynthesis (locked in organic molecules) → returned by respiration (all organisms), decomposition (bacteria/fungi break down dead material), combustion (burning). Fossil fuels formed over millions of years; burning releases ancient carbon rapidly, increasing atmospheric CO₂.

Nitrogen cycle: atmospheric N₂ → fixed by nitrogen-fixing bacteria (in soil or root nodules of legumes) to NH₃ → nitrifying bacteria convert NH₃ → NO₂⁻ → NO₃⁻ (nitrates plants absorb) → organisms incorporate nitrogen into proteins/DNA → denitrifying bacteria convert nitrates back to N₂. Decomposers return nitrogen to soil as ammonium.

Human impacts: deforestation (removes CO₂ sink, destroys habitats, reduces biodiversity), burning fossil fuels (increases CO₂, climate change), intensive farming (fertiliser runoff → eutrophication; pesticide use; habitat loss), pollution (water, land, air), overfishing. Eutrophication: excess nitrates/phosphates → algal bloom → algae block light → plants below die → decomposers increase → O₂ depleted → fish suffocate.

Biodiversity and conservation: high biodiversity provides ecosystem stability, genetic resources, medicine, and resilience. Conservation methods: wildlife reserves, seed banks, breeding programmes, international agreements (e.g. CITES), sustainable fishing quotas, reforestation.

Fieldwork methods: quadrats (estimate abundance/coverage of stationary organisms), transects (distribution along environmental gradients), mark-release-recapture for mobile animals (estimated population = (1st catch × 2nd catch) ÷ number marked in 2nd catch).`,

        solution: "Population estimate = (1st catch × 2nd catch) ÷ number marked in recapture = (40 × 50) ÷ 8 = 2000 ÷ 8 = 250 woodlice. Assumption: the marked individuals mix randomly and uniformly throughout the population between the two samples (so the ratio of marked to unmarked in the 2nd sample is representative of the whole population).

    "Biological molecules": {
      title: "Biological Molecules: Carbohydrates, Lipids, Proteins & Nucleic Acids",
      keyIdea: "All biological macromolecules are polymers built from monomers by condensation reactions; their structure directly determines their function.",
      body: `CARBOHYDRATES
Monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, galactose) are the monomers. α-glucose has the OH on C1 below the ring; β-glucose has it above. This difference dictates polymer structure: α-glucose → starch (amylose helix + amylopectin branched, energy storage in plants) and glycogen (highly branched, animal energy store in liver/muscle). β-glucose → cellulose (straight chains, H-bonds between adjacent chains → microfibrils → structural support in plant cell walls). Disaccharides: maltose (α-glu + α-glu), sucrose (α-glu + β-fru), lactose (glu + galactose) — formed by condensation (glycosidic bond, water released).

LIPIDS
Triglycerides: glycerol + 3 fatty acids joined by ester bonds (condensation). Saturated FAs (no double bonds, straight chains, pack tightly → solid at room temp, less fluid membrane). Unsaturated FAs (one or more C=C double bonds, kinked chains, pack loosely → liquid at room temp, more fluid membrane). Phospholipids: glycerol + 2 FAs + phosphate head (hydrophilic) → amphipathic → self-assemble into bilayer. Cholesterol intercalates between phospholipid tails: at low T prevents packing (maintains fluidity); at high T reduces movement (stabilises membrane) — also precursor to steroid hormones.

PROTEINS
20 amino acids, each with central C, amino group (NH₂), carboxyl group (COOH), H, and variable R group. Peptide bond (condensation between NH₂ and COOH, −H₂O) links amino acids → polypeptide. Four structure levels:
• Primary: amino acid sequence (covalent peptide bonds)
• Secondary: H-bonds between backbone NH and C=O groups → α-helix or β-pleated sheet
• Tertiary: further folding via R-group interactions (H-bonds, ionic bonds, disulfide bridges, hydrophobic interactions)
• Quaternary: multiple polypeptide subunits (e.g. haemoglobin: 4 subunits)
Fibrous proteins (collagen, keratin, actin): structural, insoluble, regular repeating structure. Globular proteins (enzymes, haemoglobin, antibodies): metabolic/transport roles, soluble, compact fold.

NUCLEIC ACIDS
DNA: double helix, antiparallel strands, deoxyribose sugar, bases A-T (2 H-bonds) and G-C (3 H-bonds). RNA: single-stranded, ribose sugar, uracil replaces thymine. ATP (adenosine triphosphate): adenine + ribose + 3 phosphates; hydrolysis of terminal phosphate releases ~30 kJ mol⁻¹, regenerated by condensation in respiration/photosynthesis.

WATER
Polar molecule (δ+ on H, δ− on O) → hydrogen bonding → cohesion, adhesion, high specific heat capacity, high latent heat of vaporisation, excellent solvent for polar/ionic solutes, metabolite in hydrolysis and condensation. Density anomaly: ice less dense than water → aquatic organisms survive winter.

FOOD TESTS
Benedict's (reducing sugars → brick-red precipitate; non-reducing require acid hydrolysis first), Biuret (protein → purple/violet), iodine (starch → blue-black), emulsion test (lipids → white emulsion in water).`,

        problem: "Explain why cellulose is unsuitable as an energy store but starch is well-suited to that role.",
        solution: "Cellulose is made of β-glucose monomers with 1,4-glycosidic bonds that produce straight, unbranched chains. Adjacent chains form extensive H-bond networks → rigid microfibrils resistant to hydrolysis; most organisms lack the enzyme cellulase. Starch (amylose + amylopectin) is made of α-glucose: amylose forms a compact helix (small, insoluble → doesn't affect osmosis inside cells); amylopectin's branching (1,6-links) provides many free ends for rapid hydrolysis by amylase → fast glucose release when energy is needed. The coiled/branched structure is also compact and osmotically inert — ideal energy store."

      keyIdea: "Eukaryotic cell ultrastructure is tightly linked to function; DNA replication is semi-conservative; mitosis and meiosis differ critically in their outcomes and purposes.",
      body: `CELL ULTRASTRUCTURE
Eukaryotic organelles (animals): nucleus (double membrane/nuclear envelope with pores; nucleolus makes rRNA; linear chromosomes), mitochondria (double membrane; cristae = folded inner membrane → large SA for ATP synthase and ETC; matrix = site of Krebs cycle; own 70S ribosomes + circular DNA → endosymbiotic origin), rough ER (ribosomes on surface → protein synthesis and folding), smooth ER (lipid/steroid synthesis, detoxification), Golgi apparatus (modifies, sorts, packages proteins into vesicles for secretion or to lysosomes), lysosomes (hydrolytic enzymes at pH ~5, digest worn organelles/pathogens), ribosomes (80S in eukaryotes: 60S + 40S; 70S in prokaryotes and organelles), centrioles (form spindle in animal cells).
Plant cells additionally: cell wall (cellulose → rigidity/support), chloroplasts (double membrane; thylakoid membranes with chlorophyll → light reactions; stroma → Calvin cycle; own 70S ribosomes; endosymbiotic), large permanent vacuole (turgor pressure), plasmodesmata (cytoplasmic connections between cells).

DNA REPLICATION (semi-conservative)
1. Helicase unwinds double helix and breaks H-bonds at the replication fork.
2. Primase lays short RNA primers on each template strand.
3. DNA polymerase III adds free DNA nucleotides 5'→3' complementary to each template strand.
4. Leading strand: synthesised continuously towards fork (one primer).
5. Lagging strand: synthesised discontinuously away from fork in Okazaki fragments (multiple primers) because polymerase can only add 5'→3'.
6. DNA polymerase I removes RNA primers and fills gaps.
7. DNA ligase seals nicks between fragments.
Evidence: Meselson & Stahl (1958) — ¹⁵N/¹⁴N density gradient centrifugation → after one replication all DNA at intermediate density (one old + one new strand).

MITOSIS
Purpose: growth, repair, asexual reproduction → 2 genetically identical diploid daughter cells.
Interphase: G1 (cell grows, protein synthesis) → S (DNA replication, chromatin condenses slightly) → G2 (further growth, organelle duplication).
PMAT: Prophase (chromosomes condense, nuclear envelope breaks down, spindle forms); Metaphase (chromosomes align at equator/metaphase plate, attached to spindle by centromeres/kinetochores); Anaphase (centromeres split, sister chromatids pulled to poles by shortening spindle fibres); Telophase (nuclear envelopes reform, chromosomes decondense) → Cytokinesis (cytoplasm divides).
Cell cycle control: cyclin-CDK complexes drive transitions through checkpoints (G1/S, G2/M). Tumour suppressor genes (e.g. p53) inhibit progression; proto-oncogenes stimulate division. Mutations → oncogenes (gain of function) or loss of tumour suppressors → uncontrolled division → cancer. Apoptosis: programmed cell death via caspase cascade — essential for development (digit formation) and immune surveillance.

MEIOSIS
Purpose: sexual reproduction → 4 genetically non-identical haploid gametes.
Meiosis I: homologous chromosomes pair up (bivalents, synapsis); crossing over at chiasmata exchanges segments between non-sister chromatids (recombination → genetic variation); homologues separated → 2 haploid cells (each still with sister chromatids).
Meiosis II: sister chromatids separated (as in mitosis) → 4 haploid cells, each genetically unique.
Sources of genetic variation: crossing over + independent assortment of bivalents (2²³ combinations in humans) + random fertilisation.`,

        solution: "At the end of meiosis I, each cell contains 23 chromosomes (haploid) but each chromosome still consists of two sister chromatids joined at the centromere. Before meiosis the DNA was replicated, so the original cell had 4× the haploid DNA content (4C). After meiosis I each cell has 23 chromosomes × 2 chromatids = 46 chromatids, so DNA content = 2C (half the pre-division 4C). After meiosis II: 23 chromosomes, 1C each."

    "Exchange & transport": {
      title: "Exchange & Transport: Gas Exchange, Circulatory Systems & Transport in Plants",
      keyIdea: "Large organisms need specialised exchange surfaces and transport systems because diffusion alone is too slow; adaptations maximise surface area, minimise diffusion distance, and maintain concentration gradients.",
      body: `FICK'S LAW
Rate of diffusion ∝ (surface area × concentration difference) ÷ diffusion pathway length.
Efficient exchange surfaces: large SA, thin walls, steep gradient (maintained by ventilation/blood flow).

GAS EXCHANGE SURFACES
Alveoli (mammals): ~700 million → enormous SA (~70 m²); walls one cell thick; rich capillary network; surfactant reduces surface tension. Ventilation maintains gradient. Fish gills: countercurrent blood flow (blood and water in opposite directions) maintains O₂ gradient along entire gill filament → >80% O₂ extracted. Parallel flow would equilibrate at ~50%. Insects: tracheae/tracheoles deliver O₂ directly to cells; spiracles (openable valves) minimise water loss; no circulatory role in O₂ transport. Leaves: stomata (pores controlled by guard cells) for CO₂/O₂ and H₂O exchange; large intercellular air spaces maximise gas contact.

OXYGEN TRANSPORT & HAEMOGLOBIN
Haemoglobin (4 subunits, each with Fe²⁺ haem group) loads O₂ in lungs (high pO₂), unloads at tissues (low pO₂). Sigmoidal dissociation curve: cooperative binding — first O₂ binding increases affinity → steep slope → efficient unloading at tissues. Bohr effect: ↑CO₂ → ↓pH → conformational change → Hb releases O₂ more readily (curve shifts right). High-altitude/foetal Hb has higher O₂ affinity (curve shifts left) — foetal HbF loads O₂ from maternal HbA at placenta. CO₂ transport: 5% dissolved, 10–15% as carbaminohaemoglobin (on Hb), ~85% as HCO₃⁻ (chloride shift maintains electrical neutrality as HCO₃⁻ leaves RBC and Cl⁻ enters).

MAMMALIAN CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Double circulation: pulmonary (R heart → lungs → L heart) + systemic (L heart → body → R heart). Maintains high pressure to systemic organs. Heart structure: SAN (pacemaker) → AVN (delay — ensures atria contract before ventricles) → Bundle of His → Purkinje fibres → ventricular walls. Myogenic: contracts without nervous stimulation. Arteries: thick muscular/elastic walls, small lumen, high pressure. Veins: thinner walls, large lumen, valves (prevent backflow). Capillaries: one cell thick (endothelium only), site of exchange. Tissue fluid formed at arterial end (hydrostatic pressure > oncotic pressure); reabsorbed at venous end (osmotic > hydrostatic) or drains via lymphatics.

TRANSPORT IN PLANTS
Xylem: carries water and mineral ions from roots to leaves. Dead, hollow, lignified (lignin waterproofs). Transpiration-cohesion-tension: water evaporates at leaf surface → tension (negative pressure) → cohesion of water (H-bonds) pulls column up → adhesion to xylem walls. Factors increasing transpiration: ↑temperature, ↑light (stomata open), ↑wind speed, ↓humidity. Xerophytes reduce transpiration: sunken stomata, rolled leaves, thick waxy cuticle, CAM metabolism (stomata open at night).
Water pathways: apoplast (cell walls, no membrane crossing — blocked by Casparian strip in endodermis); symplast (through cytoplasm via plasmodesmata — crosses membranes). Casparian strip forces all solutes through symplast → selective uptake of minerals by active transport.
Phloem: carries dissolved sugars (sucrose) and amino acids up and down. Living sieve tube elements with companion cells (mitochondria-rich, load sugar by active transport/proton cotransport). Mass flow hypothesis: active loading at source (leaves) → ↓water potential → osmosis → ↑turgor pressure → flow to sink (roots, fruits) where unloading decreases pressure.`,
      workedExample: {
        problem: "Explain why the oxygen dissociation curve for foetal haemoglobin (HbF) lies to the left of the curve for adult haemoglobin (HbA), and why this is physiologically important.",
        solution: "HbF has a higher affinity for O₂ at any given partial pressure compared to HbA — its dissociation curve is shifted left (it reaches 50% saturation at a lower pO₂, i.e. its P50 is lower). This is physiologically essential because at the placenta, maternal HbA is releasing O₂ (operating on the right part of its curve at placental pO₂ ~30–40 mmHg). HbF, with higher affinity, picks up that O₂ at the same partial pressure. The diffusion gradient is maintained from mother to foetus. If HbF had the same or lower affinity, O₂ transfer would be insufficient for foetal development."

      keyIdea: "DNA encodes protein via transcription (DNA→mRNA) and translation (mRNA→protein); mutations alter gene sequences; the genetic code is degenerate, non-overlapping and universal.",
      body: `DNA STRUCTURE RECAP
Double helix: antiparallel strands (5'→3' and 3'→5'); deoxyribose-phosphate backbone; complementary base pairs A=T (2 H-bonds), G≡C (3 H-bonds). One base + sugar + phosphate = nucleotide. Gene = sequence of base triplets (codons) encoding a polypeptide. Genetic code properties: triplet (3 bases per codon), degenerate (64 codons, 20 amino acids → most AAs coded by multiple codons), non-overlapping (each base read only once), universal (same code in nearly all organisms → basis of genetic engineering).

TRANSCRIPTION
1. RNA polymerase binds to promoter region of the gene.
2. DNA helix unwinds and H-bonds break (template strand exposed).
3. RNA polymerase moves along template strand (3'→5'), adding complementary RNA nucleotides 5'→3' (A pairs with U, not T; C pairs with G).
4. Primary transcript (pre-mRNA) formed, then processed in nucleus:
   - 5' cap and poly-A tail added (stability, ribosome recognition)
   - Splicing: introns (non-coding) removed, exons (coding) joined by spliceosomes → mature mRNA
   - Alternative splicing: different exon combinations → multiple proteins from one gene → increases proteome diversity.
5. mRNA exported through nuclear pores to cytoplasm.

TRANSLATION
Occurs at ribosomes (free in cytoplasm or on rough ER for secreted proteins).
1. mRNA binds to small ribosomal subunit; large subunit joins.
2. tRNA anticodon (complementary to mRNA codon) brings correct amino acid to A site.
3. Peptide bond forms (peptidyl transferase activity of rRNA — ribosome = ribozyme).
4. Ribosome moves 3 bases along mRNA (translocation); new tRNA enters A site.
5. Continues until stop codon (UAA, UAG, UGA) — no tRNA, release factors terminate translation.
Post-translational modification: folding, glycosylation (Golgi), cleavage (insulin precursor), phosphorylation.

MUTATIONS
Point mutations: substitution (base change — may be silent if codon still codes for same AA due to degeneracy; missense = different AA; nonsense = premature stop codon). Frameshift: insertion or deletion of a base → shifts reading frame for all codons downstream → usually catastrophic (non-functional protein).
Chromosomal mutations: deletion, duplication, inversion, translocation of chromosome segments. Polyploidy (additional whole chromosome sets) — common in plants (e.g. wheat is hexaploid).
Mutagenic agents: UV (thymine dimers → substitutions), ionising radiation (breaks), chemical mutagens (base analogues, intercalating agents, alkylating agents). DNA repair mechanisms (excision repair, mismatch repair) correct most errors.`,

      body: `PHOTOSYNTHESIS (chloroplasts)
Light-dependent reactions (thylakoid membranes):
1. Photosystems II and I contain chlorophyll and accessory pigments (carotenoids, xanthophylls) in antenna complexes.
2. Light excites electrons in PSII → electrons enter electron transport chain → released energy used to pump H⁺ across thylakoid membrane → ATP synthesised by ATP synthase (photophosphorylation).
3. Water is photolysed (split) at PSII: 2H₂O → 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ + O₂ (O₂ = waste product).
4. Electrons pass to PSI; NADP reduced to NADPH by NADP reductase.
Products of light reactions: ATP, NADPH, O₂.

Calvin Cycle (stroma):
1. CO₂ fixation: CO₂ + RuBP (5C) → 2× GP (3-phosphoglycerate, 3C) — catalysed by RuBisCO.
2. Reduction: GP + ATP + NADPH → G3P (triose phosphate, 3C).
3. Regeneration: 5/6 G3P molecules → RuBP (using ATP); 1/6 G3P used to make glucose, amino acids, lipids.
Limiting factors for photosynthesis: light intensity (limits ATP/NADPH), CO₂ concentration (limits Calvin cycle), temperature (affects enzyme activity — especially RuBisCO).

Glycolysis (cytoplasm): Glucose (6C) → 2× Pyruvate (3C) + 2 ATP (net) + 2 NADH. No O₂ needed.
Link reaction (mitochondrial matrix): Pyruvate → Acetyl-CoA (2C) + CO₂ + NADH (per pyruvate: ×2 for one glucose).
Krebs Cycle (matrix): Acetyl-CoA (2C) + Oxaloacetate (4C) → Citrate (6C) → regenerates oxaloacetate. Per turn: 3 NADH, 1 FADH₂, 1 ATP, 2 CO₂. ×2 per glucose.
Oxidative phosphorylation (inner mitochondrial membrane/cristae):
- NADH and FADH₂ donate electrons to ETC.
- Electrons pass along electron carriers → pump H⁺ from matrix to intermembrane space (chemiosmosis).
- H⁺ diffuse back through ATP synthase → ATP synthesis (Mitchell's chemiosmotic theory).
- O₂ = final electron acceptor → H₂O.
- Theoretical maximum ≈ 30–32 ATP per glucose (actual ~28 due to leakage).

ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION
Yeast: Pyruvate → Ethanol + CO₂ (using NADH → NAD+ regenerated). Used in brewing/bread.
Mammals: Pyruvate → Lactate (using NADH → NAD+ regenerated). Short-term intense exercise. Lactate transported to liver → reconverted to glucose (Cori cycle) — repays 'oxygen debt'.
Only glycolysis proceeds anaerobically → only 2 ATP net per glucose.`,

        problem: "A student investigates the effect of light intensity on the rate of photosynthesis using an aquatic plant. At very high light intensity, increasing CO₂ concentration increases the rate but increasing light intensity does not. Explain why.",
        solution: "At very high light intensity, the light-dependent reactions are operating at maximum capacity — all photosystems are saturated, producing ATP and NADPH as fast as possible. The limiting factor has shifted to the Calvin cycle: specifically, the availability of CO₂ for fixation by RuBisCO. At this point, increasing CO₂ allows RuBisCO to catalyse more fixations per unit time → more G3P produced → more glucose synthesised → rate increases. Further increases in light intensity cannot accelerate the rate because the light-dependent stage (and therefore ATP/NADPH supply) is no longer the bottleneck."

      title: "Organisms Respond to Their Environment: Nervous System, Hormones & Plant Responses",
      keyIdea: "Organisms detect stimuli and respond via nervous (fast, short-term) or hormonal (slower, longer-term) signalling; both rely on receptors, coordination, and effectors.",
      body: `NERVOUS SYSTEM
Neurons: cell body + dendrites (receive signals) + axon (transmit signals) + axon terminals. Myelinated neurons (Schwann cells form myelin sheath): saltatory conduction — action potential jumps between nodes of Ranvier → faster conduction. Unmyelinated: continuous conduction, slower.

Action potential (all-or-nothing):
1. Resting potential: −70 mV inside (Na⁺/K⁺ pump maintains: 3 Na⁺ out / 2 K⁺ in per ATP; K⁺ channels open, K⁺ diffuses out).
2. Depolarisation: stimulus → voltage-gated Na⁺ channels open → Na⁺ rushes in → membrane potential rises to +40 mV.
3. Repolarisation: Na⁺ channels close; K⁺ channels open → K⁺ rushes out → potential falls.
4. Hyperpolarisation: K⁺ channels slow to close → potential briefly more negative than −70 mV.
5. Refractory period: Na⁺ channels inactivated → absolute refractory (no AP possible); K⁺ channels still open → relative refractory (larger stimulus needed). Ensures unidirectional propagation.
Frequency of APs encodes stimulus intensity (not amplitude — all-or-nothing).

Synapses (mostly chemical):
1. AP arrives at pre-synaptic terminal; voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels open.
2. Ca²⁺ influx → vesicles fuse with pre-synaptic membrane → neurotransmitter (e.g. acetylcholine) released into cleft.
3. NT binds to receptors on post-synaptic membrane → ion channels open → EPSP or IPSP.
4. NT removed: enzymatic breakdown (acetylcholinesterase) or reuptake.
Spatial and temporal summation: multiple weak signals can sum to exceed threshold. Inhibitory synapses prevent over-firing.

HORMONAL COMMUNICATION
Hormones released into blood → travel to target cells (specific receptors). Slower but longer-lasting than nerves. Adrenaline: binds to GPCR → adenylyl cyclase → cAMP (second messenger) → protein kinase A cascade. Insulin/glucagon: regulate blood glucose (negative feedback via pancreatic β/α cells). Oestrogen/testosterone: steroid hormones → lipid-soluble → cross membrane → bind intracellular receptor → directly affect gene transcription.

PLANT RESPONSES
Auxin (IAA): produced in shoot tips; moves by active transport; promotes cell elongation (loosens cell wall for turgor-driven expansion) in stems. Phototropism: auxin moves to shaded side → cells elongate → shoot bends toward light. Gravitropism: auxin redistributes to lower side of horizontal root (inhibits elongation in roots at high concentration) → root grows downward.
Gibberellins: promote stem elongation, seed germination, break dormancy.
ABA (abscisic acid): closes stomata (drought response), promotes dormancy.`,
      workedExample: {
        problem: "Explain why an action potential is described as 'all-or-nothing' and how stimulus intensity is encoded if the AP size is always the same.",
        solution: "An action potential is all-or-nothing because: if the stimulus depolarises the membrane to threshold (~−55 mV), voltage-gated Na⁺ channels open in a positive feedback loop → full AP of fixed amplitude (~110 mV change). Below threshold, no AP is generated regardless of stimulus size. Stimulus intensity is encoded by the frequency of action potentials — a stronger stimulus causes more frequent APs because it keeps the membrane closer to threshold so it re-fires faster once the refractory period ends. The interval between APs decreases as stimulus intensity increases."

      title: "Genetics, Populations & Ecosystems: Hardy-Weinberg, Selection & Energy Flow",
      keyIdea: "Evolution is a change in allele frequency in a population; Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium defines non-evolution; ecosystems transfer energy and cycle nutrients with limited efficiency.",
      body: `POPULATIONS & EVOLUTION
Population: all members of a species in a habitat. Gene pool: all alleles of all genes in a population. Evolution = change in allele frequency over time due to: natural selection, genetic drift, mutation, gene flow.

Hardy-Weinberg Principle: in a large, randomly mating population with no mutation, selection, migration or genetic drift, allele and genotype frequencies remain constant.
Equations: p + q = 1 (p = dominant allele frequency, q = recessive allele frequency)
p² + 2pq + q² = 1 (p² = homozygous dominant, 2pq = heterozygous, q² = homozygous recessive)
Use q² = frequency of affected individuals to find q → then p = 1 − q → 2pq = carrier frequency.

NATURAL SELECTION
Directional selection: one extreme phenotype is favoured → allele frequency shifts in one direction (e.g. antibiotic resistance, industrial melanism).
Stabilising selection: intermediate phenotype favoured → variance decreases (e.g. human birth weight).
Disruptive selection: both extremes favoured over intermediate → can lead to speciation.
Selection pressure: any environmental factor that causes differential reproductive success.

SPECIATION
Allopatric: geographic isolation → separate gene pools → divergence → reproductive isolation → new species.
Sympatric: same geographic area; reproductive isolation via behavioural/seasonal/mechanical barriers → divergence.
Reproductive isolation: pre-zygotic (mating timing, behaviour, morphology) or post-zygotic (sterile hybrids, e.g. mule).

ECOSYSTEMS & ENERGY FLOW
Producers (autotrophs) → primary consumers → secondary consumers → tertiary consumers.
~10% efficiency between trophic levels (energy lost as heat in respiration, undigested material in faeces, remains not consumed).
Gross Primary Production (GPP) = total energy fixed by photosynthesis.
Net Primary Production (NPP) = GPP − respiration losses by plants. NPP is energy available to primary consumers.
Secondary production = energy assimilated by consumers − respiration.
Energy budgets: Assimilation = food ingested − faeces. Net production = assimilation − respiration.

NUTRIENT CYCLES
Carbon cycle: photosynthesis (CO₂ → organic carbon), respiration (organic → CO₂), decomposition (organic → CO₂/CH₄), combustion, ocean sequestration.
Nitrogen cycle: nitrogen fixation (N₂ → NH₃ by Rhizobium in root nodules / Azotobacter free-living), nitrification (NH₃ → NO₂⁻ → NO₃⁻ by nitrifying bacteria — aerobic), denitrification (NO₃⁻ → N₂ by denitrifying bacteria — anaerobic), decomposition (proteins → NH₃ by decomposers), assimilation (plants absorb NO₃⁻/NH₄⁺ → amino acids).

CONSERVATION
In situ: nature reserves, wildlife corridors, legal protection. Ex situ: seed banks, zoos, captive breeding. Reasons for conservation: ethical (intrinsic value), ecological (ecosystem services), economic (medicines, food security), aesthetic.`,

        solution: "CF is recessive, so affected individuals are homozygous recessive (q²). q² = 900/10,000 = 0.09. Therefore q = √0.09 = 0.3. Since p + q = 1: p = 1 − 0.3 = 0.7. Carrier frequency = 2pq = 2 × 0.7 × 0.3 = 0.42. Number of carriers = 0.42 × 10,000 = 4,200.

    "Control of gene expression": {
      title: "Control of Gene Expression: Epigenetics, Transcription Factors & Stem Cells",
      keyIdea: "Gene expression is regulated at transcription and translation; epigenetic changes alter gene expression without changing DNA sequence; stem cells have the potential to differentiate into any cell type.",
      body: `GENE EXPRESSION REGULATION
Not all genes in a cell are expressed at all times. Cells differentiate during development by switching genes on/off. Regulation occurs mainly at transcription.

Transcription factors: proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences in promoter/enhancer regions → recruit or block RNA polymerase → activate or repress transcription. Oestrogen: steroid hormone, diffuses into cell → binds intracellular receptor → receptor-hormone complex acts as transcription factor → enters nucleus → binds oestrogen response elements → activates target genes (e.g. in breast tissue proliferation).

Epigenetics: heritable changes in gene expression without altering DNA base sequence.
1. DNA methylation: methyl groups (−CH₃) added to cytosines (usually in CpG islands near promoters) by methyltransferases → condenses chromatin → silences gene. Hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes → cancer. Reversible.
2. Histone modification: acetylation of histone tails (by histone acetyltransferases) neutralises positive charge → loosens DNA-histone interaction (euchromatin) → increases gene expression. Deacetylation (by HDACs) → tighter packing (heterochromatin) → silences gene. Phosphorylation, methylation of histones also alter expression.
3. Environmental influences: diet (folate/methyl donors), toxins, stress, age → alter methylation patterns → influence gene expression → can be inherited (transgenerational epigenetics, e.g. Agouti mouse model, Dutch Hunger Winter studies).

miRNA & POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL CONTROL
Small interfering RNAs and microRNAs (~22 nucleotides) bind complementary mRNA → prevent translation or trigger mRNA degradation (RNA interference, RNAi). Natural gene regulation mechanism; used experimentally.

STEM CELLS
Totipotent: can become any cell type including extra-embryonic tissue (zygote, first few divisions).
Pluripotent: embryonic stem cells (inner cell mass) — can become any embryonic cell type but not placenta.
Multipotent: adult stem cells (e.g. haematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow) — limited lineage.
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs): somatic cells reprogrammed by introducing Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc transcription factors → pluripotent. Avoids ethical issues of embryo use; patient-matched → no immune rejection. Limitations: risk of insertional mutagenesis, incomplete reprogramming, tumour formation.

GENE EXPRESSION & CANCER
Proto-oncogenes (e.g. Ras): stimulate cell division; mutated → oncogenes → constitutively active → uncontrolled division.
Tumour suppressor genes (e.g. p53, Rb): brakes on cell cycle; mutations → both copies must be lost (two-hit hypothesis) → uncontrolled division.
Epigenetic silencing of tumour suppressors (hypermethylation) can drive cancer without DNA mutation.

GENOME SEQUENCING & APPLICATIONS
Whole genome sequencing (WGS), next-generation sequencing. Bioinformatics: compare genomes, identify mutations, classify organisms, trace evolution. Pharmacogenomics: personalised medicine based on patient's genome (drug metabolism SNPs). Gel electrophoresis: DNA fragments separated by size (smaller = further). Southern blotting, RFLP analysis, DNA profiling (STR/microsatellite repeats).`,
      workedExample: {
        problem: "Explain how histone acetylation can increase gene expression, and why this is described as an epigenetic change.",
        solution: "Histone proteins have positively charged lysine tails that interact strongly with the negatively charged phosphate backbone of DNA, keeping chromatin tightly coiled (heterochromatin) and inaccessible to RNA polymerase. Acetylation by histone acetyltransferases adds acetyl groups to lysine residues, neutralising the positive charge → electrostatic interaction with DNA weakens → chromatin relaxes into euchromatin → transcription factors and RNA polymerase can access the promoter → increased transcription of the gene. This is epigenetic because the DNA base sequence is unchanged; only the packaging/accessibility of DNA has changed. The modification can be inherited through cell division (mitosis) as histone modification patterns are partially reproduced, and in some cases can be transmitted across generations."

      commonMistakes: [
